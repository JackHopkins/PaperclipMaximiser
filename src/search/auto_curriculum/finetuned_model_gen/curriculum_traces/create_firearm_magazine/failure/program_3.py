Sure! The objective to create firearm-magazine.
To craft a firearm-magazine from scratch, we need to make a stone furnace to smelt iron ore into plates, then craft the magazine using those plates.
The final success will be checked by looking if firearm-magazine is in the inventory
Here's a policy to achieve this objective:

Objective: Craft a firearm-magazine from scratch

Planning:
We need to craft a firearm-magazine, which requires 4 iron plates. 
Since we have no items in our inventory or on the map, we need to gather all the necessary resources and craft the required items.
We need to:
1. Gather resources (iron ore, coal, stone)
2. Craft a stone furnace
3. Smelt iron ore into iron plates
4. Craft the firearm-magazine

Steps:
1. Print recipes
2. Gather resources (iron ore, coal, stone)
3. Craft and place a stone furnace
4. Smelt iron ore into iron plates
5. Craft the firearm-magazine
