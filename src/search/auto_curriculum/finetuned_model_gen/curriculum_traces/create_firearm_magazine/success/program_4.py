Objective: Craft a firearm magazine from scratch

Planning:
We need to craft a firearm magazine, which requires 4 iron plates.
There are no entities on the map or in the inventory, so we need to gather all resources and craft all necessary items.
We need to mine iron ore and coal, smelt the iron ore into plates, and then craft the magazine.
A stone furnace is also needed for smelting.
