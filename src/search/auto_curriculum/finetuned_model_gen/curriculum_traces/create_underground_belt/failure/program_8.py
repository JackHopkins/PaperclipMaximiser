Objective: Craft an underground belt from scratch

Planning:
We need to craft 1 underground belt, which requires:
- 4 transport-belts
- 1 fast-transport-belt
- 7 iron plates
- 4 iron-gear-wheels

There are no entities on the map and our inventory is empty, so we need to gather all resources from scratch.
We'll need to mine iron ore, stone, and coal, then craft stone furnaces for smelting.
