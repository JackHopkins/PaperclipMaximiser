Objective: Create a transport belt from scratch

Planning:
We need to craft a transport belt, which requires 1 iron gear wheel and 1 iron plate.
Since we have no entities on the map and an empty inventory, we need to start from scratch.
We'll need to gather resources, craft a furnace, smelt iron plates, and then craft the transport belt.
