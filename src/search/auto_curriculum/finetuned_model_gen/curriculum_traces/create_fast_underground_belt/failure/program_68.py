Step 1: Print recipes. We need to craft the following items:
- 2 underground-belts (each requires 5 iron gear wheels and 1 transport belt)
- 1 fast-underground-belt (requires 2 underground-belts and 8 iron gear wheels)

Step 2: Calculate total resources needed. We need at least 40 iron plates to craft 8 iron gear wheels and 2 transport belts.
- 8 iron gear wheels (each requires 2 iron plates)
- 4 iron plates for 2 transport belts (each requires 1 iron plate)

Step 3: Gather raw resources. We need to mine at least 40 iron ore.
- Move to the nearest iron ore patch
- Mine 40 iron ore

Step 4: Set up smelting operation. We need to smelt 40 iron ore into 40 iron plates.
- Move to the origin (0,0)
- Craft and place a stone furnace
- Insert 40 iron ore and coal into the furnace
- Wait for smelting to complete (approximately 20 seconds)
- Extract 40 iron plates from the furnace

Step 5: Craft intermediate items. We need to craft 8 iron gear wheels and 2 transport belts.
- Craft 8 iron gear wheels
- Craft 2 transport belts

Step 6: Craft final products. We need to craft 2 underground-belts and 1 fast-underground-belt.
- Craft 2 underground-belts
- Craft 1 fast-underground-belt

Step 7: Verify success. Check that we have 1 fast-underground-belt in our inventory.
