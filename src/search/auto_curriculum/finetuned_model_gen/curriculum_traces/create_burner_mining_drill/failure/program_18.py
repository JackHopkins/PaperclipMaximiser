Sure! The objective to create burner-mining-drill is achievable. Here's the policy to carry out the objective:

"""
from factorio_instance import *

"""
Craft a burner mining drill from raw materials.

:param game: The game instance.
:return: True if the burner mining drill was crafted successfully, False otherwise.
"""
"""
Planning:
We need to craft a burner mining drill. The recipe for a burner mining drill is:
- 3 iron gear wheels
- 3 iron plates
- 1 stone furnace

In total, we need at least 9 iron plates and 5 stone.
We also need coal for fuel in the furnace.
