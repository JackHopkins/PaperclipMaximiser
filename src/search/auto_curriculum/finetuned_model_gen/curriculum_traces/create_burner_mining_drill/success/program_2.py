Objective: Craft a burner-mining-drill from raw resources

Planning:
We need to craft a burner-mining-drill, which requires:
- 3 iron gear wheels
- 1 stone furnace
- 4 iron plates

There are no entities on the map or in our inventory, so we need to craft everything from scratch.
We'll need to gather raw resources, smelt iron plates, and then craft the necessary components.

Steps:
1. Print recipes
2. Gather raw resources
3. Craft stone furnace
4. Smelt iron plates
5. Craft iron gear wheels
6. Craft stone furnace
7. Craft burner-mining-drill
8. Verify crafting
