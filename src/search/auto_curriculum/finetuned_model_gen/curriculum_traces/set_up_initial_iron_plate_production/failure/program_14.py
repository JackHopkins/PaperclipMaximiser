Objective: Set up initial iron plate production

Planning:
We need to set up a burner mining drill to mine iron ore and a furnace to smelt it into iron plates.
Since we have no entities on the map or in our inventory, we need to craft everything from scratch.
We'll need to gather resources, craft intermediate items, and then set up the production line.
