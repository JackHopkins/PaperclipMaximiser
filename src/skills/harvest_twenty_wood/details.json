  "steps": "To achieve the objective of getting 20 wood in Factorio, I would follow these steps:\n\n1. Locate a forest or area with trees nearby.\n\n2. Ensure the player character has an axe equipped (this should be available from the start of the game).\n\n3. Approach the nearest tree.\n\n4. Left-click on the tree to begin chopping it down.\n\n5. Once the tree falls, it will automatically be added to your inventory.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until you have collected 20 wood.\n\n7. Check your inventory to confirm you have reached the goal of 20 wood.\n\nAdditional tips:\n\n- Each tree typically yields 4-8 wood, so you'll need to chop down approximately 3-5 trees to reach your goal.\n- Be mindful of your surroundings while chopping trees, as enemies (like biters) may approach if you're in a dangerous area.\n- If you have researched better tools, using an upgraded axe or chainsaw can speed up the wood-gathering process.\n- Remember that wood is a renewable resource in Factorio, but it's good practice to replant trees or find sustainable ways to obtain wood as you progress in the game.",
