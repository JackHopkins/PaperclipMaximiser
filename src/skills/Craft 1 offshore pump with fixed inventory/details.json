  "objective": "Craft 1 offshore pump with fixed inventory",
  "steps": "SUMMARY:\nTo craft 1 offshore pump, we need to create 2 iron gears and 1 pipe, then combine them. We have all the necessary raw materials in our inventory, so we don't need to mine or smelt anything. We'll use one of the stone furnaces we have for crafting.\n\nRequired components:\n- 2 iron gears (each requiring 2 iron plates)\n- 1 pipe (requiring 1 iron plate)\n- Total iron plates needed: 5 (we have 20 in inventory)\n\nSTEPS:\n\n1. Craft iron gears:\n   a. Craft 2 iron gears using 4 iron plates (2 plates per gear)\n   \n2. Craft pipe:\n   a. Craft 1 pipe using 1 iron plate\n   \n3. Craft offshore pump:\n   a. Use 2 iron gears and 1 pipe to craft 1 offshore pump\n\nHere's the detailed plan:\n\n1. Craft iron gears:\n   - Use the craft_item() function to create 2 iron gears\n   craft_item(Prototype.IronGear, 2)\n\n2. Craft pipe:\n   - Use the craft_item() function to create 1 pipe\n   craft_item(Prototype.Pipe, 1)\n\n3. Craft offshore pump:\n   - Use the craft_item() function to create 1 offshore pump\n   craft_item(Prototype.OffshorePump, 1)\n\n4. Verify the crafting:\n   - Use the inspect_inventory() function to check if the offshore pump is in the inventory\n   inventory = inspect_inventory()\n   print(inventory)\n\nThis plan efficiently uses the materials we have in our inventory to craft the offshore pump without any unnecessary steps or resource gathering.",
