  "steps": "To create a steel smelting chain with a burner mining drill and 2 stone furnaces in Factorio, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Place a burner mining drill on an iron ore patch.\n\n2. Place two stone furnaces near the burner mining drill.\n\n3. Set up the first stone furnace to smelt iron ore into iron plates:\n   - Use an inserter to move iron ore from the burner mining drill to the first stone furnace.\n\n4. Set up the second stone furnace to smelt iron plates into steel:\n   - Use an inserter to move iron plates from the first stone furnace to the second stone furnace.\n\n5. Fuel management:\n   - Manually add coal or wood to the burner mining drill and both stone furnaces until you can automate this process.\n\n6. Optional improvements:\n   - Add a chest between the furnaces to store excess iron plates.\n   - Set up a coal mining operation nearby to fuel the machines more efficiently.\n\nRemember that this setup is very basic and slow. For larger-scale production, you'll want to upgrade to electric mining drills, more furnaces, and eventually electric furnaces with modules and beacons for increased efficiency.",
