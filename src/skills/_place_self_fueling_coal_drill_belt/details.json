  "steps": "To achieve the objective of creating a self-fueling belt of 5 burner mining drills on coal with transport belts and inserters in Factorio, follow these steps:\n\n1. Find a suitable coal patch that can accommodate at least 5 burner mining drills side by side.\n\n2. Place 5 burner mining drills in a line, ensuring they are all mining coal.\n\n3. Place a transport belt running parallel to the line of burner mining drills, about 1 tile away from their output.\n\n4. For each burner mining drill:\n   a. Place a basic inserter between the drill's output and the transport belt, so it can place coal onto the belt.\n   b. Place another basic inserter on the opposite side of the drill, positioned to take coal from the transport belt and insert it into the drill's fuel slot.\n\n5. Extend the transport belt at both ends of the line of drills, creating a loop that connects back to itself. This forms a closed circuit for the coal to travel on.\n\n6. Place a few pieces of coal manually onto the belt to kickstart the system.\n\nThe setup should now look like this:\n\n```\nI = Inserter\nD = Burner Mining Drill\n= = Transport Belt\n\n  I I   I I   I I   I I   I I\n  D D   D D   D D   D D   D D\nI ========================== I\n```\n\nThis configuration will allow the burner mining drills to mine coal, place it on the belt, and also take coal from the belt to fuel themselves, creating a self-sustaining system. As long as there is coal available to mine, this setup will continue to function without further input.",
