  "objective": "Create a simple iron gear wheel production line using an assembling machine and inserters",
  "steps": "To create a simple iron gear wheel production line in Factorio using an assembling machine and inserters, follow these steps:\n\n1. Set up iron ore mining:\n   - Place electric mining drills on iron ore patches\n   - Connect the drills to electricity\n\n2. Establish iron plate smelting:\n   - Place stone furnaces or electric furnaces near the iron ore output\n   - Use inserters to feed iron ore into the furnaces\n   - Use inserters to remove iron plates from the furnaces\n\n3. Set up the assembling machine:\n   - Place an assembling machine 1 or 2 near the iron plate output\n   - Set the assembling machine recipe to produce iron gear wheels\n\n4. Create the input line:\n   - Use transport belts to bring iron plates from the smelting area to the assembling machine\n   - Place an inserter to feed iron plates from the belt into the assembling machine\n\n5. Set up the output:\n   - Place an inserter to remove finished iron gear wheels from the assembling machine\n   - Use a transport belt or chest to collect the produced iron gear wheels\n\n6. Power the system:\n   - Ensure all components (mining drills, inserters, and assembling machine) are connected to a power source\n\n7. Optimize and scale (optional):\n   - Add more assembling machines as needed\n   - Use faster inserters or belt types to increase throughput\n   - Consider using modules in the assembling machines to improve efficiency\n\nThis setup will create a basic iron gear wheel production line that can be easily expanded or integrated into larger factory designs.",
