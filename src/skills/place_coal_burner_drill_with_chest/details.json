  "steps": "To achieve the objective of placing a burner mining drill that mines coal with a chest at its drop position in Factorio, follow these steps:\n\n1. Locate a coal deposit on the map.\n\n2. Craft a burner mining drill if you don't already have one in your inventory.\n\n3. Craft a wooden chest (or iron chest if available) if you don't already have one.\n\n4. Position yourself next to the coal deposit.\n\n5. Select the burner mining drill from your inventory.\n\n6. Place the burner mining drill directly on top of the coal deposit, ensuring that the output arrow of the drill is pointing to an empty tile.\n\n7. Select the chest from your inventory.\n\n8. Place the chest on the tile where the burner mining drill's output arrow is pointing.\n\n9. (Optional) Place some coal in the fuel slot of the burner mining drill to get it started.\n\nThis setup will allow the burner mining drill to extract coal from the deposit and automatically place it into the adjacent chest. You can then collect the coal from the chest as needed or set up further automation from that point.\n\nRemember that the burner mining drill requires fuel to operate, so you'll need to manually refuel it with coal until you set up a more automated system later in the game.",
