  "objective": "Craft 1 offshore pump from scratch",
  "steps": "SUMMARY:\nTo craft 1 offshore pump from scratch, we need to create several intermediate components and gather raw materials. The main components required are:\n\n1. 2 Iron Gear Wheels\n2. 1 Electronic Circuit\n3. 1 Pipe\n\nThese components require the following raw materials and intermediate products:\n\n- Iron Plates (for Iron Gear Wheels, Electronic Circuit, and Pipe)\n- Copper Plates (for Electronic Circuit)\n- Copper Cable (for Electronic Circuit)\n- Stone (for Stone Furnace)\n- Coal (for fuel)\n\nWe'll need to mine iron ore, copper ore, stone, and coal, then smelt the ores into plates before crafting the final components.\n\nSTEPS:\n\n1. Mine Stone and Craft Stone Furnace:\n   a. Move to nearest stone deposit: move_to(nearest(Resource.Stone))\n   b. Mine 5 stone: harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Stone), 5)\n   c. Craft Stone Furnace: craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 1)\n\n2. Mine Coal for Fuel:\n   a. Move to nearest coal deposit: move_to(nearest(Resource.Coal))\n   b. Mine 10 coal: harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Coal), 10)\n\n3. Smelt Iron Plates:\n   a. Move to nearest iron ore deposit: move_to(nearest(Resource.IronOre))\n   b. Mine 9 iron ore: harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.IronOre), 9)\n   c. Place Stone Furnace: place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=Position(x=0, y=0))\n   d. Insert coal into furnace: insert_item(Prototype.Coal, get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, Position(x=0, y=0)), 5)\n   e. Insert iron ore into furnace: insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, Position(x=0, y=0)), 9)\n   f. Wait for smelting: sleep(10)\n   g. Extract iron plates: extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, Position(x=0, y=0), 9)\n\n4. Smelt Copper Plates:\n   a. Move to nearest copper ore deposit: move_to(nearest(Resource.CopperOre))\n   b. Mine 2 copper ore: harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.CopperOre), 2)\n   c. Insert coal into furnace: insert_item(Prototype.Coal, get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, Position(x=0, y=0)), 2)\n   d. Insert copper ore into furnace: insert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, Position(x=0, y=0)), 2)\n   e. Wait for smelting: sleep(5)\n   f. Extract copper plates: extract_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, Position(x=0, y=0), 2)\n\n5. Craft Iron Gear Wheels:\n   a. Craft 2 Iron Gear Wheels: craft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, 2)\n\n6. Craft Copper Cable:\n   a. Craft 3 Copper Cable: craft_item(Prototype.CopperCable, 3)\n\n7. Craft Electronic Circuit:\n   a. Craft 1 Electronic Circuit: craft_item(Prototype.ElectronicCircuit, 1)\n\n8. Craft Pipe:\n   a. Craft 1 Pipe: craft_item(Prototype.Pipe, 1)\n\n9. Craft Offshore Pump:\n   a. Craft 1 Offshore Pump: craft_item(Prototype.OffshorePump, 1)\n\nThis plan ensures that we craft all necessary components and gather all required raw materials to create 1 offshore pump from scratch. The process involves mining, smelting, and crafting various intermediate products before finally assembling the offshore pump.",
