  "objective": "Craft 1 steam engine with fixed inventory",
  "steps": "SUMMARY\nTo craft 1 steam engine, we need to create several intermediate components and then assemble them. The main components required are:\n- 10 iron plates\n- 10 copper plates\n- 5 pipes\n- 1 iron gear wheel\n\nFortunately, we have most of the raw materials in our inventory, including iron plates, copper plates, and coal. We also have stone furnaces which we can use for crafting if needed. The main steps will involve crafting the pipes and iron gear wheel, and then assembling the steam engine.\n\nSTEPS\n1. Craft 5 pipes:\n   - Each pipe requires 1 iron plate\n   - We have enough iron plates in our inventory\n   - Use the craft_item() function to create 5 pipes\n\n2. Craft 1 iron gear wheel:\n   - Each iron gear wheel requires 2 iron plates\n   - We have enough iron plates in our inventory\n   - Use the craft_item() function to create 1 iron gear wheel\n\n3. Craft 1 steam engine:\n   - Use the craft_item() function to create 1 steam engine\n   - This will use:\n     * 10 iron plates\n     * 10 copper plates\n     * 5 pipes (crafted in step 1)\n     * 1 iron gear wheel (crafted in step 2)\n\nHere's the detailed plan:\n\n1. Craft 5 pipes:\n   craft_item(Prototype.Pipe, 5)\n\n2. Craft 1 iron gear wheel:\n   craft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, 1)\n\n3. Craft 1 steam engine:\n   craft_item(Prototype.SteamEngine, 1)\n\nAfter these steps, we should have successfully crafted 1 steam engine using the materials from our inventory and the intermediate components we crafted.",
