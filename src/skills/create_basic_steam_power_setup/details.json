  "objective": "create an offshore pump, boiler and steam engine connected with pipes",
  "steps": "To achieve the objective of creating an offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine connected with pipes in Factorio, follow these steps:\n\n1. Find a suitable water source (lake or ocean) near your base.\n\n2. Place an offshore pump directly adjacent to the water source.\n\n3. Place a boiler next to the offshore pump, leaving one tile of space between them.\n\n4. Connect the offshore pump to the boiler using pipes.\n\n5. Place a steam engine next to the boiler, again leaving one tile of space between them.\n\n6. Connect the boiler to the steam engine using pipes.\n\n7. Ensure the correct orientation of components:\n   - Offshore pump: Output facing the boiler\n   - Boiler: Water input facing the pump, steam output facing the engine\n   - Steam engine: Steam input facing the boiler\n\n8. Provide fuel (e.g., coal or wood) to the boiler by hand or using an inserter.\n\n9. Connect the steam engine to your electrical network using small electric poles.\n\nThis setup will create a basic power generation system. The offshore pump will supply water to the boiler, which will heat it to produce steam. The steam will then power the steam engine, generating electricity for your base.",
