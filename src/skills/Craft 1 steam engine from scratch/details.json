  "objective": "Craft 1 steam engine from scratch",
  "steps": "SUMMARY:\nTo craft 1 steam engine from scratch, we need to create several intermediate components and set up a production chain. The main components required are:\n\n1. Iron plates (10)\n2. Copper plates (5)\n3. Pipes (5)\n4. Gears (8)\n\nWe'll need to mine iron ore, copper ore, stone, and coal. We'll craft multiple stone furnaces for smelting and crafting. The process will involve mining, smelting, and crafting various components before finally assembling the steam engine.\n\nSTEPS:\n\n1. Mine resources:\n   a. Mine 25 stone (5 for each stone furnace, we'll need at least 5)\n   b. Mine 30 iron ore (for iron plates and gears)\n   c. Mine 10 copper ore (for copper plates)\n   d. Mine 20 coal (for fuel)\n\n2. Craft stone furnaces:\n   a. Craft 5 stone furnaces using 25 stone\n\n3. Smelt iron plates:\n   a. Place 2 stone furnaces\n   b. Insert coal as fuel\n   c. Smelt 20 iron ore into 20 iron plates\n\n4. Smelt copper plates:\n   a. Place 1 stone furnace\n   b. Insert coal as fuel\n   c. Smelt 10 copper ore into 10 copper plates\n\n5. Craft gears:\n   a. Use 10 iron plates to craft 5 iron gears (2 iron plates per gear)\n\n6. Craft pipes:\n   a. Use 5 iron plates to craft 5 pipes (1 iron plate per pipe)\n\n7. Craft the steam engine:\n   a. Place an assembling machine (if available) or use hand crafting\n   b. Input the following materials:\n      - 10 iron plates\n      - 8 gears\n      - 5 pipes\n      - 5 copper plates\n   c. Craft 1 steam engine\n\n8. Collect the crafted steam engine\n\nNote: If an assembling machine is not available and hand crafting is required, ensure you have enough inventory space for all the components before starting the final assembly of the steam engine.\n\nThis plan takes into account the need for multiple stone furnaces, both for smelting and as crafting components. We craft 5 stone furnaces to ensure we have enough for smelting iron and copper, as well as having spares for future use or as components in other recipes if needed.",
