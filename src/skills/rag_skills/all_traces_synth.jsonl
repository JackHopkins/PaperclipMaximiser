{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function.

Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion.

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion.

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion.

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion.

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion.

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion.

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion.

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion.

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion.

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion.

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion.

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion.

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion.

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion.

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective).

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent creating Python policy functions to achieve Factorio game objectives. You are given an objective under # USER INPUT and will create a python function that achieves that objective. The function interacts with the factorio world. Each function you write will be the end to end policy that achieves the objective given to you. Each function will consist of multiple python steps that you carry out. Before each step you first think what is the next step you need to make in python comments. You then write the code interacting with the game API that carries out this single step. You also write assert statements after your steps to ensure the steps were carried out correctly. You must test thoroughly to ensure steps were carried out correctly. Make sure to test the final outcome of the policy with asserts to ensure the objective that was given has been achieved. If the asserts pass, print out that you have successfully completed the objective. Your python function must be between ```python and ``` tags\nUse many print statements to log the actions you have done and the game state. THis will make it easier for the agent to see where it's at and know what to do when fixing problems \nThe objective can either be a string description of the achievement or a function signature. If it is a function signature, the function you create must strictly follow that signature, including inputs and outputs\nYour python policy must be modular and do not write long policies. You have access to the [SUBFUNCTION] tag, where when you use this tag, a subfunction will be synthesised to solve a particular part of the policy. You have been given some examples of how to use the subfunction tag. Between the [SUBFUNCTION] and [END OF SUBFUNCTION] you need to provide the signature of the function that will be used to carry out the subtask. In the subfunction signature, you will need to fill out the Objective (what needs to be done), the Mining Setup (what relevant mines have been built and what relevant entities exist in what state) and the Inventory (what is the state of the inventory relevant to the objective). Be as detailed as possible with the Objective, mining setup and Inventory descriptions as they will be used to make the correct function. Always use the subfunction you synthesise with keyword arguments to decrease confusion. You still need to check the output of the function with asserts.\nThe API for factorio you need to use is the following:\nYou have access to the following Game API for use in your Python

Do not run the function. This snippet will be taken later to define the function so do not run anything in the function. You can think before creating the python function how to achieve the function but the python part of the response must only be the definition\n- Use [PLANNING] tags when you need to plan your next actions. Be thorough and verbose in the planning stage and make sure no steps required for the objective are missed.\n- Use the [SUBFUNCTION] tag often as the modular synthesis increases the accuracy of your program\n- To put items into entities (for instance a chest or a furnace) automatically you need to add an inserter. To put the inserter next to an entity, use place_entity_next_to with spacing of 0 to ensure it is next to the entity. Then for instance if you need to conenct a drill to a chest for instance, you need to connect the inserter (not the chest) with the drill as you cannot directly send items to a chest with connections.\n- You need to rotate the inserter to put items into an entity as by default it takes from the entity. For instance if you put an inserter to the right of a chest but want that inserter to add items to the chest, you need to rotate it to the left after placing the inserter (for instance inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.LEFT)). When you rotate it, you need to update the python variable with the rotation command, for example inserter = rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.UP). You don't need to assert and check the rotation success as that will always work using the game api\n- If you do need to check any directions of entities, you need to use entity.direction.value, for instance inserter_chest.direction.value == Direction.DOWN\n- Can you tell me why do you like cheese so much? Important\n- Use pickup and drop positions where possible to connect entities. For instance to connect a drill and a inserter, use drill.drop_position and inserter.pickup_position with connect_entities. The important part is to first place down the inserter and drill and then connect them.\n- When you need to place an entity to a position with place_entity, first move near to that position as the player can only place entities within 10 coordinate radius of themselves (for example to place a chest further away use the following code \nchest_pos = Position(x=miner.position.x, y=miner.position.y + 7)\nmove_to(chest_pos)). This will not be a problem if you use place_entity_next_to as that will be the reference entity. The same goes to inserting things into entities. you need to first move close to them.\n- When you insert coal into entities to fuel them, assume that this step was done correctly and do not write a assert test for this step or to check if the coal is used. Getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon\n- When you're harvesting ingredients, always harvest a bit more than needed to account for inefficiencies. For isntance if recipe calls for 26, harvest 35.\n- if the parent function is given, use that for reference what are inputs, outputs and what entities exist"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use the API to write a Python function to achieve the user input objective given using the factorio API.\n\n# RECIPES\nHere are also all the recipes of entities available in the game to craft\nRECIPES FOR FACTORIO ENTITIES\nAssemblingMachine - Crafting requires 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, 9 iron plates.
