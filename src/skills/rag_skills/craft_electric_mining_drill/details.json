    "\nTo craft an electric mining drill, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Gather raw resources:\n   - Mine at least 25 iron ore (23 for the drill, plus extra for buffer)\n   - Mine at least 10 copper ore (5 for the drill, plus extra for buffer)\n   - Mine at least 10 coal (for smelting)\n   - Mine at least 5 stone (for a stone furnace)\n\n2. Craft a stone furnace:\n   - Use 5 stone to craft a stone furnace\n\n3. Smelt iron plates:\n   - Place the stone furnace\n   - Insert coal into the furnace\n   - Insert iron ore into the furnace\n   - Wait for the smelting process to complete\n   - Collect at least 23 iron plates\n\n4. Smelt copper plates:\n   - Insert coal into the furnace (if needed)\n   - Insert copper ore into the furnace\n   - Wait for the smelting process to complete\n   - Collect at least 5 copper plates\n\n5. Craft intermediate components:\n   - Craft 5 iron gear wheels (requires 10 iron plates)\n   - Craft 9 copper cables (requires 5 copper plates)\n   - Craft 3 electronic circuits (requires 3 iron plates and 9 copper cables)\n\n6. Craft the electric mining drill:\n   - Use 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, and 10 iron plates to craft the electric mining drill\n\n7. Check the inventory:\n   - Verify that an electric mining drill is now in the inventory\n\nThroughout this process, ensure to move near the required locations for mining and placing the furnace, as the player can only interact within a 10 coordinate radius.\n\n",
    "\nTo achieve this objective of smelting iron and copper ores into plates using a furnace, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the required resources:\n   - Iron ore needed = iron_amount (as 1 iron ore produces 1 iron plate)\n   - Copper ore needed = copper_amount (as 1 copper ore produces 1 copper plate)\n   - Coal needed = ceil((iron_amount + copper_amount) / 8) (as 1 coal can smelt 8 items)\n\n2. Check if we have enough resources in the inventory:\n   - Verify we have at least the calculated amounts of iron ore, copper ore, and coal\n\n3. Smelt iron plates:\n   - Insert the required amount of coal into the furnace\n   - Insert iron_amount of iron ore into the furnace\n   - Wait for the smelting process to complete (1 second per iron ore)\n   - Extract iron_amount of iron plates from the furnace\n\n4. Smelt copper plates:\n   - If there's not enough coal in the furnace, insert more\n   - Insert copper_amount of copper ore into the furnace\n   - Wait for the smelting process to complete (0.5 seconds per copper ore)\n   - Extract copper_amount of copper plates from the furnace\n\n5. Clean up:\n   - Remove any remaining coal from the furnace (if any)\n\n6. Verify results:\n   - Check that we have iron_amount of iron plates in our inventory\n   - Check that we have copper_amount of copper plates in our inventory\n\nNote: We don't need to return anything as the plates will be added to the inventory automatically after smelting.\n"
