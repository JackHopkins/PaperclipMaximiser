  "steps": "SUMMARY:\nTo craft 1 copper plate from scratch, we need to follow these main steps:\n1. Mine stone to craft a stone furnace\n2. Craft a stone furnace\n3. Mine coal for fuel\n4. Mine copper ore\n5. Smelt copper ore into copper plate\n\nRequired components and actions:\n- 5 stone (for crafting stone furnace)\n- 1 stone furnace\n- 1 coal (for fuel)\n- 1 copper ore\n- Mining (stone, coal, copper ore)\n- Crafting (stone furnace)\n- Smelting (copper ore to copper plate)\n\nSTEPS:\n\n1. Mine stone:\n   - Move to the nearest stone resource patch\n   - Use harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Stone), 5) to mine 5 stone\n\n2. Craft stone furnace:\n   - Use craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 1) to craft 1 stone furnace\n\n3. Mine coal:\n   - Move to the nearest coal resource patch\n   - Use harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Coal), 1) to mine 1 coal\n\n4. Mine copper ore:\n   - Move to the nearest copper ore resource patch\n   - Use harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.CopperOre), 1) to mine 1 copper ore\n\n5. Place stone furnace:\n   - Find a suitable location near the copper ore patch\n   - Use place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, Direction.UP, Position(x, y)) to place the stone furnace\n\n6. Insert fuel and copper ore into the furnace:\n   - Use insert_item(Prototype.Coal, stone_furnace, 1) to insert coal\n   - Use insert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, stone_furnace, 1) to insert copper ore\n\n7. Wait for smelting:\n   - Use sleep(5) to wait for the smelting process to complete\n\n8. Extract copper plate:\n   - Use extract_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, stone_furnace.position, 1) to get the copper plate\n\nThis plan ensures that we craft 1 copper plate from scratch, taking into account all the necessary steps and components required for the process.",
