  "objective": "Craft 2 steel plates with fixed inventory",
  "steps": "SUMMARY\nTo craft 2 steel plates, we need to smelt iron plates into steel plates using a stone furnace. Each steel plate requires 5 iron plates and coal for fuel. We already have all the necessary materials in our inventory, including stone furnaces, iron plates, and coal. This simplifies our process significantly.\n\nRequired components:\n- 10 iron plates (5 per steel plate)\n- Coal for fuel\n- 1 stone furnace\n\nAll of these components are already available in our inventory.\n\nSTEPS\n\n1. Place a stone furnace:\n   - Use the place_entity function to place a stone furnace at a suitable location.\n   place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, Direction.UP, Position(x=0, y=0))\n\n2. Insert fuel into the furnace:\n   - Insert coal into the stone furnace for fuel.\n   insert_item(Prototype.Coal, stone_furnace, 5)\n\n3. Insert iron plates into the furnace:\n   - Insert 10 iron plates into the stone furnace (5 for each steel plate).\n   insert_item(Prototype.IronPlate, stone_furnace, 10)\n\n4. Wait for the smelting process:\n   - The smelting process for steel takes longer than regular smelting. We'll need to wait for it to complete.\n   sleep(10)  # Adjust the time as needed based on the game's smelting speed\n\n5. Extract the steel plates:\n   - Once the smelting is complete, extract the 2 steel plates from the furnace.\n   extract_item(Prototype.SteelPlate, stone_furnace.position, 2)\n\n6. Confirm the crafting:\n   - Check the inventory to ensure we have crafted 2 steel plates.\n   inventory = inspect_inventory()\n   print(f\"Steel plates in inventory: {inventory.get('steel-plate', 0)}\")\n\nThis plan efficiently uses the materials already available in the inventory to craft 2 steel plates without the need for additional mining or crafting of components. The process is straightforward since we have all the necessary items, including the stone furnace, iron plates, and coal for fuel.",
