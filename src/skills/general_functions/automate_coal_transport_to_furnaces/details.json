  "steps": "To create an automated coal transportation system from a mining drill to 3 stone furnaces in Factorio, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Place the coal mining drill:\n   - Find a coal deposit\n   - Place an electric mining drill on the coal patch\n\n2. Set up power:\n   - Place a small electric pole near the mining drill to power it\n\n3. Create the transportation system:\n   - Place 3 transport belts leading from the output of the mining drill\n   - At the end of the belt line, split it into 3 directions using a splitter\n\n4. Place the stone furnaces:\n   - Position 3 stone furnaces at the end of each belt line coming from the splitter\n\n5. Set up inserters:\n   - Place 3 burner inserters, one in front of each stone furnace\n   - Ensure the inserters are positioned to grab coal from the belt and place it into the furnaces\n\n6. Optional optimization:\n   - If you want to ensure even distribution, you can add two more splitters after the first one to create three equal paths\n\n7. Power the inserters:\n   - Since you're using burner inserters, manually add some coal to each one to get them started\n\nThis setup will automatically mine coal and distribute it evenly among the three stone furnaces, keeping them fueled for smelting operations.\n\nRemember to monitor the system periodically to ensure it's running smoothly and that the coal supply is sufficient for your needs.",
