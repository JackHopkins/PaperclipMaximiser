  "steps": "Certainly! I'll create a comprehensive plan to craft 1 transport belt from scratch using the Factorio game API. Let's break this down into a summary and detailed steps.\n\nSUMMARY:\nTo craft 1 transport belt, we need 1 iron gear wheel and 1 iron plate. The iron gear wheel itself requires 2 iron plates. So in total, we need 3 iron plates to craft 1 transport belt. We'll need to mine iron ore, smelt it into iron plates, craft an iron gear wheel, and finally craft the transport belt.\n\nRequired components:\n- 3 iron plates (1 for the transport belt, 2 for the iron gear wheel)\n- 1 stone furnace (for smelting iron ore)\n- Coal (for fuel in the stone furnace)\n\nSTEPS:\n\n1. Mine stone:\n   - Move to the nearest stone resource: move_to(nearest(Resource.Stone))\n   - Mine 5 stone: harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Stone), 5)\n\n2. Craft stone furnace:\n   - Craft 1 stone furnace: craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 1)\n\n3. Mine coal:\n   - Move to the nearest coal resource: move_to(nearest(Resource.Coal))\n   - Mine 5 coal: harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Coal), 5)\n\n4. Mine iron ore:\n   - Move to the nearest iron ore resource: move_to(nearest(Resource.IronOre))\n   - Mine 3 iron ore: harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.IronOre), 3)\n\n5. Place stone furnace:\n   - Place the stone furnace near the iron ore: place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, Direction.UP, nearest(Resource.IronOre))\n\n6. Smelt iron plates:\n   - Insert coal into the furnace: insert_item(Prototype.Coal, get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, nearest(Prototype.StoneFurnace)), 1)\n   - Insert iron ore into the furnace: insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, nearest(Prototype.StoneFurnace)), 3)\n   - Wait for smelting to complete: sleep(10)\n\n7. Collect iron plates:\n   - Extract 3 iron plates from the furnace: extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, nearest(Prototype.StoneFurnace), 3)\n\n8. Craft iron gear wheel:\n   - Craft 1 iron gear wheel: craft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, 1)\n\n9. Craft transport belt:\n   - Craft 1 transport belt: craft_item(Prototype.TransportBelt, 1)\n\nThis plan ensures that we have all the necessary components to craft 1 transport belt from scratch, including mining the required resources, smelting iron ore into iron plates, and crafting the intermediate iron gear wheel before finally crafting the transport belt.",
