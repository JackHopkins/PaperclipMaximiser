  "objective": "Set up an automated stone brick production line using burner mining drills and stone furnaces",
  "steps": "To set up an automated stone brick production line using burner mining drills and stone furnaces in Factorio, follow these steps:\n\n1. Locate a stone deposit:\n   - Find a suitable stone deposit near your starting area.\n\n2. Place burner mining drills:\n   - Position 2-3 burner mining drills directly on the stone deposit.\n   - Ensure they have space to output the mined stone.\n\n3. Fuel the burner mining drills:\n   - Insert coal or wood into each burner mining drill to power them.\n\n4. Set up stone furnaces:\n   - Place 2-3 stone furnaces near the burner mining drills.\n   - Leave enough space between them for inserters and belts.\n\n5. Create a basic transport system:\n   - Use short stretches of transport belt to move stone from the mining drills to the furnaces.\n   - Alternatively, use inserters if the distance is very short.\n\n6. Fuel the stone furnaces:\n   - Insert coal or wood into each stone furnace to power them.\n\n7. Automate fuel distribution (optional but recommended):\n   - Set up a separate burner mining drill on a coal deposit.\n   - Use transport belts and/or inserters to distribute coal to both the stone mining drills and furnaces.\n\n8. Collect the output:\n   - Place a chest or short stretch of transport belt at the output of each stone furnace to collect the stone bricks.\n\n9. Maintain the system:\n   - Periodically check fuel levels in the mining drills and furnaces.\n   - Collect the produced stone bricks from the output area.\n\nThis setup will create a basic automated stone brick production line. As you progress in the game, you can upgrade this system with electric mining drills, more efficient furnaces, and longer transport belts for increased production and automation.",
