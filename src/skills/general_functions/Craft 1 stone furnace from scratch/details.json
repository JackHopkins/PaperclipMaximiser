  "steps": "Certainly! I'll create a comprehensive plan to craft 1 stone furnace from scratch using the Factorio game API. Here's the plan:\n\nSUMMARY\nTo craft 1 stone furnace, we need 5 stone. The stone furnace is a basic crafting component that doesn't require any other ingredients or structures to create. We'll need to locate stone resources, mine them, and then craft the furnace.\n\nRequired components:\n- 5 stone\n\nActions:\n1. Locate stone resources\n2. Mine stone\n3. Craft stone furnace\n\nSTEPS\n\n1. Locate the nearest stone resource:\n   ```python\n   stone_position = nearest(Resource.Stone)\n   ```\n\n2. Move to the stone resource:\n   ```python\n   move_to(stone_position)\n   ```\n\n3. Harvest 5 stone:\n   ```python\n   harvested = harvest_resource(stone_position, quantity=5)\n   if harvested < 5:\n       print(\"Not enough stone harvested. Trying to harvest more.\")\n       while harvested < 5:\n           harvested += harvest_resource(stone_position, quantity=5-harvested)\n   ```\n\n4. Verify that we have enough stone in our inventory:\n   ```python\n   inventory = inspect_inventory()\n   if inventory.get(Prototype.Stone, 0) < 5:\n       print(\"Error: Not enough stone in inventory.\")\n       return\n   ```\n\n5. Craft the stone furnace:\n   ```python\n   crafted = craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, quantity=1)\n   if crafted == 0:\n       print(\"Error: Failed to craft stone furnace.\")\n       return\n   ```\n\n6. Verify that the stone furnace was crafted successfully:\n   ```python\n   inventory = inspect_inventory()\n   if inventory.get(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 0) < 1:\n       print(\"Error: Stone furnace not found in inventory after crafting.\")\n   else:\n       print(\"Successfully crafted 1 stone furnace!\")\n   ```\n\nThis plan ensures that we locate the necessary resources, harvest them, and craft the stone furnace. It also includes error checking at each step to make sure we have the required materials and that the crafting process is successful.",
