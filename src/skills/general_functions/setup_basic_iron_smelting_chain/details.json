  "objective": "create a fueled iron burner mining drill that feeds into a stone furnace which uses an inserter to fill up a chest with iron plates.",
  "steps": "To achieve this objective in Factorio, follow these steps:\n\n1. Place an iron ore patch:\n   - Find or create an area with iron ore.\n\n2. Set up the burner mining drill:\n   - Place a burner mining drill directly on top of the iron ore patch.\n   - Fuel the burner mining drill with coal or wood.\n\n3. Position the stone furnace:\n   - Place a stone furnace adjacent to the output side of the burner mining drill.\n\n4. Add an inserter:\n   - Place an inserter next to the stone furnace, positioned so it can take items from the furnace's output.\n\n5. Place a chest:\n   - Put a wooden or iron chest next to the inserter, opposite the furnace.\n\n6. Configure the inserter:\n   - Ensure the inserter is oriented correctly to move items from the furnace to the chest.\n\n7. Fuel the stone furnace:\n   - Add coal or wood to the stone furnace to keep it running.\n\n8. Start the process:\n   - The burner mining drill will extract iron ore and output it directly into the stone furnace.\n   - The stone furnace will smelt the iron ore into iron plates.\n   - The inserter will move the iron plates from the furnace to the chest.\n\n9. Maintain fuel levels:\n   - Regularly check and refuel both the burner mining drill and the stone furnace to keep the system running.\n\nThis setup will continuously produce iron plates and store them in the chest, achieving your stated objective.",
