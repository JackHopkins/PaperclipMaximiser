  "steps": "To set up a small copper wire production facility using an assembling machine in Factorio, follow these steps:\n\n1. Mine copper ore:\n   - Find a copper ore patch\n   - Place electric mining drills on the copper ore\n\n2. Smelt copper plates:\n   - Build stone furnaces or electric furnaces\n   - Create a belt system to transport copper ore from the miners to the furnaces\n   - Ensure power supply to the furnaces if using electric ones\n\n3. Set up the assembling machine:\n   - Place an assembling machine (preferably Assembling Machine 1 or higher)\n   - Ensure it has power supply\n\n4. Configure the assembling machine:\n   - Open the assembling machine interface\n   - Select the copper wire recipe\n\n5. Input logistics:\n   - Create a belt system to transport copper plates from the smelting area to the assembling machine\n   - Use an inserter to feed copper plates into the assembling machine\n\n6. Output logistics:\n   - Place an inserter to remove the produced copper wire from the assembling machine\n   - Set up a belt or chest to collect the copper wire output\n\n7. Optimize (optional):\n   - Add more assembling machines if higher production is needed\n   - Use faster inserters or belt types for improved efficiency\n\nRemember that one copper plate produces two copper wires, so plan your input/output logistics accordingly. This setup will provide a steady supply of copper wire for your factory's needs.",
