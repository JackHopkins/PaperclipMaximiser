  "objective": "Here's a new, single-task objective for the Factorio curriculum:\n\nCraft 20 copper cables using copper plates in your inventory.\n\nThis objective is different from the examples provided, focuses on a single task, and introduces players to the basic crafting mechanic using a new resource (copper).",
  "steps": "To achieve the objective of crafting 20 copper cables using copper plates in your inventory in Factorio, I would outline the following plan:\n\n1. Locate copper ore:\n   - Explore the map to find copper ore deposits, which appear as orange patches on the ground.\n\n2. Mine copper ore:\n   - Use your mining tool (likely a pickaxe at this stage) to mine the copper ore.\n   - Collect at least 10 pieces of copper ore, as each copper plate requires 1 copper ore to craft.\n\n3. Smelt copper ore into copper plates:\n   - Build a stone furnace if you haven't already.\n   - Place the copper ore into the furnace.\n   - Wait for the furnace to smelt the ore into copper plates.\n   - Collect the copper plates from the furnace output.\n\n4. Access the crafting menu:\n   - Open your inventory by pressing 'E' (default key).\n   - Look for the crafting menu within the inventory screen.\n\n5. Locate the copper cable recipe:\n   - Find the copper cable recipe in the crafting menu.\n   - Note that each copper plate produces 2 copper cables.\n\n6. Craft copper cables:\n   - Select the copper cable recipe.\n   - Click the craft button or press the appropriate key to craft copper cables.\n   - Repeat the crafting process until you have produced 20 copper cables.\n\n7. Verify completion:\n   - Check your inventory to confirm that you have crafted 20 copper cables.\n\nThis plan introduces players to the basic resource gathering, smelting, and crafting mechanics of Factorio while focusing on a single, specific task using copper as a new resource.",
