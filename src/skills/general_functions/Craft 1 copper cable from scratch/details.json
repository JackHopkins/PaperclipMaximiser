  "steps": "SUMMARY:\nTo craft 1 copper cable from scratch, we need to go through several steps, including mining resources, crafting a stone furnace, smelting copper ore into copper plates, and finally crafting the copper cable. Here's a summary of the required components and actions:\n\n1. Mine 5 stone (for crafting stone furnace)\n2. Craft 1 stone furnace\n3. Mine coal (for fuel)\n4. Mine copper ore\n5. Smelt copper ore into copper plates\n6. Craft copper cable\n\nSTEPS:\n\n1. Mine stone:\n   - Move to the nearest stone resource patch\n   - Mine 5 stone using the harvest_resource() function\n\n2. Craft stone furnace:\n   - Use craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 1) to create a stone furnace\n\n3. Mine coal:\n   - Move to the nearest coal resource patch using move_to(nearest(Resource.Coal))\n   - Mine at least 2 coal using harvest_resource()\n\n4. Find and mine copper ore:\n   - Move to the nearest copper ore patch using move_to(nearest(Resource.CopperOre))\n   - Mine at least 1 copper ore using harvest_resource()\n\n5. Place and fuel the stone furnace:\n   - Place the stone furnace near the copper ore patch using place_entity()\n   - Insert coal into the furnace using insert_item()\n\n6. Smelt copper ore into copper plate:\n   - Insert the copper ore into the furnace using insert_item()\n   - Wait for the smelting process to complete (you can use sleep() if necessary)\n   - Extract the copper plate from the furnace using extract_item()\n\n7. Craft copper cable:\n   - Use craft_item(Prototype.CopperCable, 1) to create 1 copper cable from the copper plate\n\n8. Confirm crafting:\n   - Check your inventory using inspect_inventory() to ensure you have 1 copper cable\n\nThis plan takes into account all the necessary steps to craft 1 copper cable from scratch, including mining the required resources, crafting intermediate items (stone furnace and copper plate), and finally crafting the copper cable itself.",
