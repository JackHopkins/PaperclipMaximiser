  "objective": "Build a radar and power it to start revealing the surrounding area",
  "steps": "To achieve the objective \"Build a radar and power it to start revealing the surrounding area\" in Factorio, follow these steps:\n\n1. Gather resources:\n   - Mine iron ore and smelt it into iron plates\n   - Mine copper ore and smelt it into copper plates\n   - Mine coal for fuel\n\n2. Craft necessary components:\n   - Create iron gears from iron plates\n   - Create electronic circuits using iron plates and copper cables\n\n3. Build a radar:\n   - Open the crafting menu\n   - Select the radar recipe\n   - Craft the radar (typically requires iron plates, iron gears, and electronic circuits)\n\n4. Set up power generation:\n   - Build a steam engine setup:\n     a. Place a offshore pump near water\n     b. Connect it to a boiler\n     c. Connect the boiler to a steam engine\n   - Or, if you have unlocked solar panels, place solar panels\n\n5. Create power poles:\n   - Craft small power poles or medium power poles\n\n6. Place the radar:\n   - Find a suitable location for the radar\n   - Place the radar on the ground\n\n7. Connect power to the radar:\n   - Place power poles to create a connection between your power source and the radar\n   - Ensure the power line reaches the radar\n\n8. Verify operation:\n   - Check that the radar is receiving power (you should see it rotating)\n   - Open your map to see the area being scanned and revealed\n\nBy following these steps, you'll have a functioning radar that will start to reveal the surrounding area on your map. Remember to maintain power supply to keep the radar operational.",
