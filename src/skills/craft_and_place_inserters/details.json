  "objective": "New objective:\n\nCraft and place 3 inserters to automatically transfer items between structures\n\nThis objective introduces the player to inserters, a crucial component in Factorio's automation systems. It's a single, clear task that builds upon the previous transport belt objective by teaching players how to move items between structures automatically. This step is different from the previous examples and further develops the player's understanding of basic automation in the game.",
  "steps": "To achieve the objective of crafting and placing 3 inserters to automatically transfer items between structures in Factorio, I would suggest the following plan:\n\n1. Gather required materials:\n   - 3 Iron plates\n   - 3 Iron gear wheels\n   - 3 Electronic circuits\n\n2. Craft the inserters:\n   - Open the crafting menu\n   - Select the inserter recipe\n   - Craft 3 inserters\n\n3. Identify suitable locations:\n   - Look for two adjacent structures that would benefit from item transfer\n   - Examples could be:\n     a) A mining drill and a chest\n     b) A furnace and a chest\n     c) An assembling machine and a chest\n\n4. Place the inserters:\n   - Position the cursor between the two structures\n   - Rotate the inserter if necessary (using 'R' key) to ensure correct orientation\n   - Place the inserter\n   - Repeat for all 3 inserters\n\n5. Test the setup:\n   - Ensure the inserters are picking up items from one structure and placing them in the other\n   - Watch the inserters work for a few cycles to confirm proper functioning\n\n6. Optimize if needed:\n   - Adjust inserter positions or orientations if they're not working as intended\n   - Consider power supply if the inserters aren't moving (they require electricity)\n\nThis plan introduces the player to the concept of automated item transfer, a fundamental aspect of Factorio's gameplay. It builds upon previous knowledge of crafting and structure placement while introducing a new, more advanced automation concept.",
