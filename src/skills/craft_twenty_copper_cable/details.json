  "steps": "To achieve the objective of crafting 20 copper cable in Factorio, you would follow these steps:\n\n1. Gather resources:\n   - Mine copper ore from copper deposits using a mining drill or by hand.\n\n2. Smelt copper ore:\n   - Set up a stone furnace or electric furnace.\n   - Feed copper ore into the furnace to smelt it into copper plates.\n\n3. Craft copper cable:\n   - Open your crafting menu.\n   - Select the copper cable recipe, which requires 1 copper plate to produce 2 copper cables.\n   - Craft 10 times to produce 20 copper cables (since each craft yields 2 cables).\n\nAlternative automated approach:\n1. Set up an automated copper ore mining operation.\n2. Create a smelting line to turn copper ore into copper plates.\n3. Set up an assembling machine:\n   - Place an assembling machine (level 1 or higher).\n   - Set the recipe to copper cable.\n   - Feed copper plates into the machine using an inserter.\n   - Use another inserter to remove the finished copper cables.\n   - Let the machine run until you have 20 or more copper cables.\n\n4. Collect the copper cables from the output of the assembling machine.\n\nThis automated method is more efficient for larger-scale production and future needs.",
