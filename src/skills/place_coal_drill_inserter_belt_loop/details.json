  "objective": "place a coal burner mining drill, with an inserter next to the drill facing towards it, add a transport belt connecting the drill drop off to the inserter pick up to complete the loop",
  "steps": "To achieve this objective in Factorio, follow these steps:\n\n1. Place a coal burner mining drill:\n   - Find a suitable coal patch on the map\n   - Select the coal burner mining drill from your inventory\n   - Place it directly on top of the coal patch\n\n2. Add an inserter next to the drill:\n   - Select an inserter from your inventory\n   - Place it adjacent to the coal burner mining drill\n   - Ensure the inserter is facing towards the drill (the arrow on the inserter should point towards the drill)\n\n3. Add a transport belt:\n   - Select a transport belt from your inventory\n   - Start placing the belt from the output side of the coal burner mining drill\n   - Extend the belt towards the input side of the inserter\n\n4. Complete the loop:\n   - Continue the transport belt from the inserter's output side\n   - Connect it back to the input side of the coal burner mining drill\n\nThe final setup should look like this:\n\n[Coal] -> [Drill] -> [Belt] -> [Inserter] -> [Belt] -> [Drill]\n\nThis configuration creates a closed loop where:\n- The drill mines coal and outputs it onto the belt\n- The belt carries the coal to the inserter\n- The inserter picks up the coal and places it back into the drill\n- The drill uses the coal as fuel to continue mining\n\nThis setup ensures that the coal burner mining drill is self-sustaining, using the coal it mines to power itself and continue operation.",
