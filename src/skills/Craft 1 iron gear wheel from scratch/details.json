  "steps": "Certainly! I'll create a comprehensive plan to craft 1 iron gear wheel from scratch using the Factorio game API. Let's break this down into a summary and detailed steps.\n\nSUMMARY:\nTo craft 1 iron gear wheel, we need to go through several stages:\n1. Mine stone to craft a stone furnace\n2. Mine coal for fuel\n3. Mine iron ore\n4. Smelt iron ore into iron plates\n5. Craft iron gear wheel\n\nRequired components:\n- 5 stone (for stone furnace)\n- Coal (for fuel)\n- 4 iron ore (2 iron ore = 2 iron plates, and 2 iron plates = 1 iron gear wheel)\n- 1 stone furnace\n- 2 iron plates\n\nSTEPS:\n\n1. Mine stone:\n   ```python\n   stone_position = nearest(Resource.Stone)\n   move_to(stone_position)\n   harvest_resource(stone_position, quantity=5)\n   ```\n\n2. Craft stone furnace:\n   ```python\n   craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, quantity=1)\n   ```\n\n3. Mine coal:\n   ```python\n   coal_position = nearest(Resource.Coal)\n   move_to(coal_position)\n   harvest_resource(coal_position, quantity=10)  # Mine extra for fuel\n   ```\n\n4. Find and move to iron ore:\n   ```python\n   iron_ore_position = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\n   move_to(iron_ore_position)\n   ```\n\n5. Place stone furnace:\n   ```python\n   furnace = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, direction=Direction.UP, position=Position(x=0, y=-1))\n   ```\n\n6. Mine iron ore:\n   ```python\n   harvest_resource(iron_ore_position, quantity=4)\n   ```\n\n7. Insert coal into furnace:\n   ```python\n   insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\n   ```\n\n8. Insert iron ore into furnace:\n   ```python\n   insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, quantity=4)\n   ```\n\n9. Wait for smelting to complete:\n   ```python\n   sleep(10)  # Assuming it takes about 10 seconds to smelt 4 iron ore\n   ```\n\n10. Extract iron plates from furnace:\n    ```python\n    extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace.position, quantity=2)\n    ```\n\n11. Craft iron gear wheel:\n    ```python\n    craft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, quantity=1)\n    ```\n\n12. Verify the iron gear wheel is in the inventory:\n    ```python\n    inventory = inspect_inventory()\n    if inventory.get(Prototype.IronGearWheel) >= 1:\n        print(\"Successfully crafted 1 iron gear wheel!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Failed to craft iron gear wheel. Please check the process.\")\n    ```\n\nThis plan takes into account all the necessary steps to craft an iron gear wheel from scratch, including mining the required resources, crafting the stone furnace, smelting iron ore into iron plates, and finally crafting the iron gear wheel. The plan also ensures that we don't use the placed stone furnace for any other recipe, as it's needed for smelting the iron ore.",
