  "objective": "create a steam power setup with a steam boiler, offshore pump and steam engine, connected to an assembling machine via power poles",
  "steps": "To achieve this objective in Factorio, follow these steps:\n\n1. Place an offshore pump near a body of water.\n\n2. Connect the offshore pump to a boiler using pipes.\n\n3. Place a steam engine next to the boiler.\n\n4. Connect the boiler to the steam engine using pipes.\n\n5. Place power poles to create an electrical network:\n   - Put one power pole next to the steam engine.\n   - Extend the power network by placing additional power poles as needed.\n\n6. Place an assembling machine within reach of the power network.\n\n7. Connect the assembling machine to the power network using a power pole.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown:\n\n1. Offshore pump: Provides water for the steam system.\n2. Boiler: Heats the water to create steam.\n3. Steam engine: Converts steam into electrical power.\n4. Power poles: Distribute electricity from the steam engine to other structures.\n5. Assembling machine: Powered by the electricity from the steam power setup.\n\nMake sure all components are properly connected and have the necessary resources (coal for the boiler). This setup will provide a basic power generation system and allow you to start automated crafting with the assembling machine.",
