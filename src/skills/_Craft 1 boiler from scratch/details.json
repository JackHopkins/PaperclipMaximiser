  "steps": "Certainly! I'll create a comprehensive plan to craft 1 boiler from scratch using the Factorio game API. Let's break this down into a summary and detailed steps.\n\nSUMMARY:\nTo craft 1 boiler, we need 4 stone furnaces and 10 pipes. This means we'll need to gather raw materials, craft intermediate products, and finally assemble the boiler. The main components and actions required are:\n\n- Mine stone (for stone furnaces and pipes)\n- Mine iron ore (for pipes)\n- Craft stone furnaces (4)\n- Smelt iron plates (10)\n- Craft pipes (10)\n- Craft boiler (1)\n\nSTEPS:\n\n1. Gather raw materials:\n   a. Mine 20 stone (5 for each stone furnace)\n   b. Mine 10 iron ore (1 for each pipe)\n\n2. Craft stone furnaces:\n   a. Craft 4 stone furnaces using 5 stone each (total 20 stone)\n   b. Place 1 stone furnace for smelting iron plates\n\n3. Prepare fuel:\n   a. Mine coal (at least 10 pieces) for fueling the stone furnace\n\n4. Smelt iron plates:\n   a. Place coal in the stone furnace\n   b. Insert 10 iron ore into the stone furnace\n   c. Wait for 10 iron plates to be produced\n\n5. Craft pipes:\n   a. Craft 10 pipes using 1 iron plate each\n\n6. Craft boiler:\n   a. Ensure you have 4 stone furnaces and 10 pipes in your inventory\n   b. Craft 1 boiler using 4 stone furnaces and 10 pipes\n\nDetailed step-by-step implementation using the game API:\n\n1. Gather raw materials:\n   ```python\n   # Mine stone\n   for _ in range(4):\n       move_to(nearest(Resource.Stone))\n       harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Stone), 5)\n   \n   # Mine iron ore\n   move_to(nearest(Resource.IronOre))\n   harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.IronOre), 10)\n   ```\n\n2. Craft stone furnaces:\n   ```python\n   for _ in range(4):\n       craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 1)\n   \n   # Place one stone furnace for smelting\n   furnace = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, Direction.UP, Position(x=0, y=0))\n   ```\n\n3. Prepare fuel:\n   ```python\n   move_to(nearest(Resource.Coal))\n   harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Coal), 10)\n   ```\n\n4. Smelt iron plates:\n   ```python\n   insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, 5)\n   insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, 10)\n   \n   # Wait for smelting to complete\n   sleep(10)\n   \n   # Extract iron plates\n   for _ in range(10):\n       extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace.position, 1)\n   ```\n\n5. Craft pipes:\n   ```python\n   for _ in range(10):\n       craft_item(Prototype.Pipe, 1)\n   ```\n\n6. Craft boiler:\n   ```python\n   craft_item(Prototype.Boiler, 1)\n   ```\n\nThis plan ensures that we have all the necessary components to craft 1 boiler from scratch. We carefully manage the stone furnaces, using one for smelting iron plates while keeping the other three for crafting the boiler. The plan also accounts for gathering all required raw materials and crafting intermediate products before assembling the final boiler.",
