  "steps": "Certainly! I'll create a comprehensive plan to craft 1 burner-mining-drill from scratch using the game's API and resources. Let's break this down into a summary and detailed steps.\n\nSUMMARY\nTo craft 1 burner-mining-drill, we need the following components:\n- 3 iron plates\n- 3 iron gear wheels\n- 1 stone furnace\n\nThe process will involve mining raw resources (iron ore and stone), smelting iron ore into iron plates, crafting iron gear wheels, crafting a stone furnace, and finally assembling the burner-mining-drill.\n\nRequired raw resources:\n- 9 iron ore (3 for iron plates, 6 for iron gear wheels)\n- 5 stone (for stone furnace)\n- Coal for fuel\n\nSTEPS\n\n1. Mine raw resources:\n   a. Move to nearest iron ore patch\n   b. Mine 9 iron ore\n   c. Move to nearest stone patch\n   d. Mine 5 stone\n   e. Move to nearest coal patch\n   f. Mine some coal for fuel (at least 5 pieces)\n\n2. Craft first stone furnace:\n   a. Use the crafting recipe for stone furnace (5 stone)\n   b. Craft 1 stone furnace\n\n3. Smelt iron plates:\n   a. Place the stone furnace\n   b. Insert coal as fuel\n   c. Insert 3 iron ore\n   d. Wait for 3 iron plates to be produced\n   e. Extract 3 iron plates from the furnace\n\n4. Craft iron gear wheels:\n   a. Use the crafting recipe for iron gear wheel (2 iron plates each)\n   b. Craft 3 iron gear wheels (using 6 iron plates)\n\n5. Craft second stone furnace:\n   a. Move away from the first stone furnace\n   b. Use the crafting recipe for stone furnace (5 stone)\n   c. Craft 1 more stone furnace\n\n6. Craft burner-mining-drill:\n   a. Use the crafting recipe for burner-mining-drill (3 iron plates, 3 iron gear wheels, 1 stone furnace)\n   b. Craft 1 burner-mining-drill\n\nHere's how we would implement this plan using the game's API:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Mine raw resources\nmove_to(nearest(Resource.Iron))\nharvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Iron), 9)\n\nmove_to(nearest(Resource.Stone))\nharvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Stone), 5)\n\nmove_to(nearest(Resource.Coal))\nharvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Coal), 5)\n\n# Step 2: Craft first stone furnace\ncraft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 1)\n\n# Step 3: Smelt iron plates\nfurnace = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, Direction.UP, Position(x=0, y=0))\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, 1)\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, 3)\nsleep(5)  # Wait for smelting to complete\nextract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace.position, 3)\n\n# Step 4: Craft iron gear wheels\ncraft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, 3)\n\n# Step 5: Craft second stone furnace\nmove_to(Position(x=2, y=0))  # Move away from the first furnace\ncraft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 1)\n\n# Step 6: Craft burner-mining-drill\ncraft_item(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, 1)\n\nprint(\"Burner-mining-drill crafted successfully!\")\n```\n\nThis plan ensures that we craft all necessary components, including an extra stone furnace for the final recipe, without using the placed furnace as a crafting component. The process is optimized to minimize movement and resource usage while crafting the burner-mining-drill from scratch.",
