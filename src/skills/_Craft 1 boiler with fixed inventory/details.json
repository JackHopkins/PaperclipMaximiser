  "objective": "Craft 1 boiler with fixed inventory",
  "steps": "SUMMARY\nTo craft 1 boiler, we need 4 stone furnaces and 20 iron plates. We already have 3 stone furnaces and 20 iron plates in our inventory, so we only need to craft 1 more stone furnace. The process will involve crafting the additional stone furnace and then using it along with the iron plates to craft the boiler.\n\nRequired components:\n- 4 stone furnaces (3 in inventory, 1 to be crafted)\n- 20 iron plates (already in inventory)\n\nSTEPS\n\n1. Craft 1 stone furnace:\n   - We already have 3 stone furnaces in our inventory, so we only need to craft 1 more.\n   - The recipe for a stone furnace requires 5 stone.\n   - Use the craft_item() function to create 1 stone furnace:\n     craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 1)\n\n2. Craft the boiler:\n   - Now that we have all the required components (4 stone furnaces and 20 iron plates), we can craft the boiler.\n   - Use the craft_item() function to create 1 boiler:\n     craft_item(Prototype.Boiler, 1)\n\n3. Verify the crafting:\n   - Use the inspect_inventory() function to check if the boiler has been successfully crafted:\n     inventory = inspect_inventory()\n     print(inventory)\n\nThis plan efficiently uses the materials already available in the inventory and only crafts the additional stone furnace needed to complete the boiler recipe. The process is straightforward since we have most of the required materials on hand.",
