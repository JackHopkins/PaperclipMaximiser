  "steps": "Certainly! I'll create a comprehensive plan to craft 1 iron chest from scratch using the Factorio game API. Let's break this down into a summary and detailed steps.\n\nSUMMARY:\nTo craft 1 iron chest, we need 8 iron plates. To get iron plates, we need to mine iron ore and smelt it in a stone furnace. The process involves mining stone and iron ore, crafting a stone furnace, mining coal for fuel, smelting iron ore into iron plates, and finally crafting the iron chest.\n\nRequired components:\n- 8 iron plates (each requiring 1 iron ore)\n- 1 stone furnace (requiring 5 stone)\n- Coal for fuel\n- Iron ore (at least 8)\n- Stone (at least 5)\n\nSTEPS:\n\n1. Mine stone:\n   - Move to the nearest stone resource patch\n   - Use harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Stone), 5)\n\n2. Craft stone furnace:\n   - Use craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 1)\n\n3. Mine coal:\n   - Move to the nearest coal resource patch\n   - Use harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Coal), 10)\n\n4. Mine iron ore:\n   - Move to the nearest iron ore resource patch\n   - Use harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.IronOre), 8)\n\n5. Place stone furnace:\n   - Find a suitable location\n   - Use place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, Direction.UP, Position(x=0, y=0))\n\n6. Smelt iron plates:\n   - Insert coal into the furnace:\n     Use insert_item(Prototype.Coal, stone_furnace, 5)\n   - Insert iron ore into the furnace:\n     Use insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, stone_furnace, 8)\n   - Wait for smelting to complete:\n     Use sleep(10)\n\n7. Extract iron plates:\n   - Use extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, stone_furnace.position, 8)\n\n8. Craft iron chest:\n   - Use craft_item(Prototype.IronChest, 1)\n\n9. Verify crafting:\n   - Check inventory to confirm iron chest has been crafted:\n     inventory = inspect_inventory()\n     if inventory.get(Prototype.IronChest) >= 1:\n         print(\"Successfully crafted 1 iron chest!\")\n     else:\n         print(\"Failed to craft iron chest. Please check the process.\")\n\nThis plan ensures that we have all the necessary components and follows a step-by-step process to craft an iron chest from scratch. It takes into account the need for a stone furnace both as a crafting tool and as a placed entity for smelting iron plates.",
