  "objective": "Craft 1 iron plate from scratch",
  "steps": "SUMMARY:\nTo craft 1 iron plate from scratch, we need to follow these main steps: mine stone, craft a stone furnace, mine coal for fuel, mine iron ore, and smelt the iron ore into an iron plate. The key components and actions required are:\n\n1. Stone (5 pieces) for crafting the stone furnace\n2. Coal (at least 1 piece) for fuel\n3. Iron ore (1 piece) for smelting into iron plate\n4. Crafting 1 stone furnace\n5. Smelting process\n\nSTEPS:\n\n1. Mine stone:\n   - Move to the nearest stone resource patch using `move_to(nearest(Resource.Stone))`\n   - Mine 5 stone using `harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Stone), 5)`\n\n2. Craft stone furnace:\n   - Use `craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 1)` to craft 1 stone furnace\n\n3. Mine coal:\n   - Move to the nearest coal resource patch using `move_to(nearest(Resource.Coal))`\n   - Mine at least 1 coal using `harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Coal), 1)`\n\n4. Mine iron ore:\n   - Move to the nearest iron ore resource patch using `move_to(nearest(Resource.IronOre))`\n   - Mine 1 iron ore using `harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.IronOre), 1)`\n\n5. Place and set up the stone furnace:\n   - Find a suitable location near the iron ore patch\n   - Place the stone furnace using `place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, Direction.UP, Position(x, y))`\n\n6. Insert fuel and iron ore into the furnace:\n   - Insert coal into the furnace using `insert_item(Prototype.Coal, stone_furnace, 1)`\n   - Insert iron ore into the furnace using `insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, stone_furnace, 1)`\n\n7. Wait for smelting process:\n   - Use `sleep(5)` to wait for the smelting process to complete\n\n8. Extract the iron plate:\n   - Extract the iron plate from the furnace using `extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, stone_furnace.position, 1)`\n\nThis plan ensures that we have all the necessary components and follows the correct sequence of actions to craft 1 iron plate from scratch, taking into account the need for a stone furnace, fuel, and iron ore.",
