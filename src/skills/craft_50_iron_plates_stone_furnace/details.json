  "objective": "Craft 50 iron plates using a stone furnace",
  "steps": "To achieve the objective of crafting 50 iron plates using a stone furnace in Factorio, you can follow this plan:\n\n1. Gather resources:\n   - Mine coal for fuel\n   - Mine iron ore\n\n2. Build a stone furnace:\n   - Craft a stone furnace using 5 stone\n   - Place the stone furnace on the ground\n\n3. Set up the smelting process:\n   - Place coal in the fuel slot of the stone furnace\n   - Place iron ore in the input slot of the stone furnace\n\n4. Start smelting:\n   - The furnace will automatically start smelting iron ore into iron plates\n   - Each iron ore produces one iron plate\n   - The process takes a few seconds per plate\n\n5. Monitor and maintain:\n   - Keep adding coal to the fuel slot as needed\n   - Continue adding iron ore to the input slot\n\n6. Collect iron plates:\n   - Remove completed iron plates from the output slot\n   - Store them in your inventory or in a nearby chest\n\n7. Repeat until goal is reached:\n   - Continue the process until you have crafted 50 iron plates\n\n8. Optional optimization:\n   - If you have the resources, consider building multiple stone furnaces to speed up the process\n   - Set up a basic automation system with inserters and belts to feed ore and fuel into the furnace(s) and collect the finished plates\n\nRemember that one stone furnace can produce 30 iron plates per minute when constantly fueled and supplied with ore, so it should take less than two minutes to achieve this goal with a single furnace if managed efficiently.",
