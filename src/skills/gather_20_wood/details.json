  "steps": "To achieve the objective of getting 20 wood in Factorio, I would follow these steps:\n\n1. Locate a forest or area with trees nearby.\n\n2. Ensure the player character has an axe equipped (this should be available from the start of the game).\n\n3. Approach the nearest tree.\n\n4. Left-click on the tree to begin chopping it down.\n\n5. Once the tree is felled, it will automatically be added to your inventory.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until you have collected 20 wood.\n\n7. Check your inventory to confirm you have reached the goal of 20 wood.\n\nAdditional tips:\n\n- Each tree typically yields 4-8 wood, so you'll need to chop down approximately 3-5 trees to reach your goal.\n- Be aware of your surroundings while chopping trees, as enemies might approach.\n- If you have researched better tools, such as a chainsaw, you can use that to gather wood more quickly.\n- Remember that wood is a renewable resource in Factorio, so don't worry about depleting the forest entirely.\n\nOnce you have collected 20 wood, you can use it for various purposes such as crafting basic items, fueling furnaces, or progressing to more advanced technologies.",
