  "objective": "Here's a new, single-task objective for the Factorio curriculum:\n\nCraft 5 copper wire using copper plates in your inventory.\n\nThis objective introduces the player to basic crafting, focusing on a simple but essential item in Factorio. It's different from the previous examples as it doesn't involve resource gathering or smelting, but instead teaches the player how to use materials they've already collected to create a new item.",
  "steps": "To achieve the objective of crafting 5 copper wire using copper plates in your inventory in Factorio, I would suggest the following plan:\n\n1. Ensure you have the necessary materials:\n   - Check your inventory for copper plates. You need at least 2 copper plates to craft 5 copper wire (1 copper plate creates 2 copper wire).\n\n2. Access the crafting menu:\n   - Press 'E' to open your inventory and crafting interface.\n\n3. Locate the copper wire recipe:\n   - In the crafting menu, find the icon for copper wire. It should be one of the basic recipes available from the start.\n\n4. Craft the copper wire:\n   - Click on the copper wire recipe.\n   - The game will automatically use the copper plates from your inventory.\n   - Click the craft button or press and hold the left mouse button to craft multiple times.\n   - Craft until you have created 5 copper wire.\n\n5. Verify the result:\n   - Check your inventory to confirm you now have 5 copper wire.\n\n6. Close the inventory:\n   - Press 'E' again to close the inventory and return to the game.\n\nThis process introduces the player to the basic crafting mechanics in Factorio, teaching them how to convert raw materials (copper plates) into a more refined product (copper wire) using the in-game crafting interface. It's a fundamental skill that will be used throughout the game for creating more complex items and structures.",
