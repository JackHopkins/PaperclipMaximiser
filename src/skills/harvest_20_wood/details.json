  "steps": "To achieve the objective of getting 20 wood in Factorio, I would follow these steps:\n\n1. Locate a forest or area with trees nearby.\n\n2. Ensure the player character has an axe equipped (this should be available from the start of the game).\n\n3. Approach the nearest tree.\n\n4. Left-click on the tree to begin chopping it down.\n\n5. Wait for the tree to fall, which will yield wood.\n\n6. Collect the wood by walking over it or clicking on it.\n\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until you have collected 20 wood.\n\n8. Check your inventory to confirm you have reached the goal of 20 wood.\n\nAdditional tips:\n\n- Each tree typically yields 4-8 wood, so you'll need to chop down approximately 3-5 trees to reach your goal.\n- Be aware of your surroundings while chopping trees, as enemies might approach.\n- If you have researched better tools, using an upgraded axe or chainsaw can speed up the process.\n- Remember that wood is a renewable resource in Factorio, so you can always replant trees if needed for sustainable wood production in the future.",
