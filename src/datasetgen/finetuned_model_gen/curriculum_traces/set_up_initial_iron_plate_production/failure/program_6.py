Objective: Set up initial iron plate production

Planning:
We need to set up a basic iron smelting operation. This requires a stone furnace and coal for fuel.
There are no entities on the map or in our inventory, so we need to start from scratch.
We'll need to gather stone for the furnace, coal for fuel, and iron ore to smelt.
