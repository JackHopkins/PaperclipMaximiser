Objective: Craft an underground-belt from scratch

Planning:
We need to craft an underground-belt. The recipe for underground-belt requires:
- 6 iron plates
- 10 iron gear wheels
- 2 transport belts

We need to craft all components from scratch as we have nothing in our inventory.
We'll need to gather iron ore, coal for fuel, and stone for furnaces.
We'll need to smelt iron plates, craft iron gear wheels, transport belts, and then the underground-belt.
