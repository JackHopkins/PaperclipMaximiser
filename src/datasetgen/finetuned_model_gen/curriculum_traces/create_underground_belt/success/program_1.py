Objective: Craft an underground-belt from scratch

Planning:
We need to craft an underground-belt which requires:
- 2 transport belts (4 iron plates, 4 iron gear wheels)
- 10 iron plates

In total, we need at least 14 iron plates and 4 iron gear wheels.

Since we have no entities on the map or in our inventory, we need to:
1. Gather raw resources (iron ore, coal, stone)
2. Craft and set up smelting infrastructure
3. Craft intermediate products
4. Craft the final product

Let's break this down into detailed steps.
"""

"""
Step 1: Gather raw resources
- We need to mine iron ore, coal, and stone
- We need 21 iron ore (for iron plates and iron gear wheels)
- We need 10 coal (for fueling the furnaces and drills)
- We need 12 stone (for crafting 2 stone furnaces)
