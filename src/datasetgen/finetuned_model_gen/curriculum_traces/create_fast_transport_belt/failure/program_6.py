Sure! The objective requires us to create a fast transport belt from scratch. We have no items in our inventory or on the map, so we need to craft everything from raw materials. We need to craft a transport belt first and then upgrade it to a fast transport belt. To do this, we need to mine iron ore, smelt it into iron plates, craft iron gear wheels, craft a transport belt, and finally upgrade it to a fast transport belt.
The final success should be checked by looking if the fast transport belt is in inventory
Here's a thorough plan to achieve the objective of creating a fast transport belt:

1. Print recipes:
   - Fast Transport Belt: 1 fast transport belt requires 1 iron gear wheel and 1 transport belt
   - Transport Belt: 1 transport belt requires 1 iron gear wheel and 1 iron plate
   - Iron Gear Wheel: 1 iron gear wheel requires 2 iron plates

2. Analyze the current setup:
   - There are no entities on the map
   - The inventory is empty

3. Calculate required resources:
   - For 1 fast transport belt, we need:
     - 1 iron gear wheel (2 iron plates)
     - 1 transport belt (1 iron gear wheel, 1 iron plate)
     - Total: 4 iron plates
   - We'll mine extra iron ore for safety, so we'll mine 10 iron ore

4. Gather raw materials:
   - Mine 10 iron ore
   - Mine 5 coal for fuel
   - Mine 5 stone for crafting a stone furnace

5. Craft and set up smelting:
   - Craft 1 stone furnace using 5 stone
   - Place the stone furnace
   - Add 5 coal to the furnace as fuel

6. Smelt iron plates:
   - Insert 10 iron ore into the stone furnace
   - Wait for smelting to complete (approximately 14 seconds for 10 iron plates)
   - Extract the 10 iron plates from the furnace

7. Craft intermediate products:
   - Craft 2 iron gear wheels (4 iron plates used)

8. Craft transport belt:
   - Craft 1 transport belt using the remaining iron gear wheel and iron plate

9. Craft fast transport belt:
   - Craft 1 fast transport belt using the iron gear wheel and transport belt

10. Verify success:
    - Check the inventory to confirm we have 1 fast transport belt

This plan takes into account the need to craft everything from scratch, including the mining of raw materials, smelting process, and crafting of intermediate products. It also includes a safety margin by mining extra iron ore. The plan is thorough and considers all steps needed to achieve the objective of creating a fast transport belt from an empty inventory and map.
