Objective: Create a firearm magazine from scratch

Planning:
We need to create a firearm magazine, but we have no items in our inventory and no entities on the map.
To craft a firearm magazine, we need 4 iron plates.
We need to smelt iron ore into iron plates, which requires a furnace.
We'll need to mine all the necessary resources (stone, coal, iron ore) and craft the required items.
