Step 1: Print recipes. We need to print the recipes for the final item we need to craft
We need to craft a fast-underground-belt from scratch. There are no entities on the map or in our inventory.
To craft a fast-underground-belt, we need 2 iron gear wheels and 1 underground belt.
The underground belt itself requires 10 iron gear wheels and 1 transport belt.
We'll need to gather resources, smelt iron plates, and craft the necessary components.
We also need to create a temporary mining and smelting setup to produce the required iron plates and gear wheels.
