Sure! Here's a policy to achieve the objective of creating a fast-underground-belt

"""
To craft a fast-underground-belt, we need 2 iron gear wheels and 2 underground belts.
There are no entities on the map or in our inventory, so we need to craft everything from scratch.

1) We need to craft the following items:
- 2 iron gear wheels
- 2 underground belts
- 1 fast-underground-belt
2) We need to craft and place the following entities:
- burner mining drill
- stone furnace
3) We need to gather the following resources:
- iron ore
- coal
- stone for furnace
4) We need to smelt the iron ore into iron plates
5) We need to craft the intermediate products (iron gear wheels, underground belts)
6) We need to craft the final product (fast-underground-belt)
