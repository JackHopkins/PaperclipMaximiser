Sure! The objective requires us to create a fast-underground-belt from scratch. Here's a thorough plan to achieve this objective along with the final policy to carry it out:

"""
To craft a fast-underground-belt, we need 1 underground-belt. 
The recipe for a fast-underground-belt is 1 underground-belt and 4 iron gear wheels.
We need to craft the underground-belt from scratch as well as the iron gear wheels.
We also need to smelt iron plates for the iron gear wheels.
To do this, we need to mine iron ore and coal for fuel, and craft a stone furnace for smelting.
We'll also need to craft the iron gear wheels.
Finally, we'll craft the fast-underground-belt.
