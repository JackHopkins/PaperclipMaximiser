Objective: Create a fast-underground-belt from scratch

Planning:
We need to create a fast-underground-belt from scratch. There are no entities on the map, so we need to gather all the resources and craft the necessary components.
We need to print out the recipes for the items we need to craft.
We need to gather coal, stone, and iron ore. We need to craft stone furnaces for smelting. 
We need to smelt iron plates, craft iron gear wheels, underground belts, and finally the fast-underground-belt.
