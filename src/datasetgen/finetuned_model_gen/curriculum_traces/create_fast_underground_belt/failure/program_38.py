Step 1: Print recipes. We need to print the recipes for the following items:
- burner mining drill
- stone furnace
- iron gear wheels
- transport belt
- fast-underground-belt

"""
Step 2: Gather raw resources. We need to gather the following resources:
- At least 98 iron ore
- At least 7 coal
- At least 6 stone

Step 4: Place and fuel stone furnace. We need to:
- Place the stone furnace
- Add coal to the furnace as fuel
"""

"""
Step 5: Smelt iron plates. We need to:
- Smelt 98 iron ore into 98 iron plates
- Ensure there is enough coal to keep the furnace running
- Extract the iron plates from the furnace

Step 6: Craft intermediate items. We need to craft the following intermediate items:
- 20 iron gear wheels (requires 40 iron plates)
- 2 underground-belt (requires 4 iron gear wheels and 2 transport belts, which in turn requires 2 iron gear wheels and 4 iron plates)
