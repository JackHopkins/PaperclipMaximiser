Objective: Craft a fast-underground-belt from raw materials

Planning:
We need to craft a fast-underground-belt. To do this, we need to craft the following intermediate items:
- Iron gear wheels (40)
- Underground belts (2)

There are no entities on the map, so we need to craft everything from scratch.
We'll need to gather raw resources, set up smelting, and craft the required items.
