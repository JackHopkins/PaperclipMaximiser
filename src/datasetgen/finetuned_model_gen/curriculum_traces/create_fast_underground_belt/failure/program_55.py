Objective: Craft a fast-underground-belt from scratch

Planning:
We need to craft iron gear wheels and underground belts to produce a fast-underground-belt. 
There are no entities on the map or items in the inventory, so we need to gather all resources and craft all intermediate products.
We need to gather iron ore, smelt it into iron plates, and then craft the required items.
We'll need at least one stone furnace for smelting.
