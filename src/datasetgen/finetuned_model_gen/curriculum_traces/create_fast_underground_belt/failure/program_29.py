Objective: Craft a fast-underground-belt from raw materials

Planning:
We need to craft a fast-underground-belt, which requires 2 underground-belts and 40 iron-gear-wheels.
We have nothing in our inventory, so we need to gather all resources from scratch.
We'll need to set up a basic mining and smelting operation to get the iron plates and coal.
We'll need to craft intermediate components like iron gear wheels and underground belts.
Finally, we'll craft the fast-underground-belt.
