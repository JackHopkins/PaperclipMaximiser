Objective: Craft a burner mining drill from scratch

Planning:
We need to craft a burner mining drill, which requires:
- 3 iron gear wheels
- 1 stone furnace
- 3 iron plates

In total, we need at least 9 iron plates and 5 stone.
We also need coal for smelting.

Steps:
1. Print recipes for required items
2. Gather raw resources (iron ore, coal, stone)
3. Craft a stone furnace
4. Smelt iron plates
5. Craft iron gear wheels
6. Craft the burner mining drill
