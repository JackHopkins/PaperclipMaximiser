Objective: Create a burner mining drill from scratch

Planning:
We need to create a burner mining drill from scratch. There are no entities on the map, so we need to gather all the resources ourselves.
We need to craft a stone furnace and then use it to smelt iron plates. Finally, we can craft the burner mining drill.
The final success will be checked by looking if we have a burner mining drill in inventory
