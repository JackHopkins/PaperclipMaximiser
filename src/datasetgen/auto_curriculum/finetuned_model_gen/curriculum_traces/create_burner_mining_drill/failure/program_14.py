Objective: Craft a burner mining drill from scratch

Planning:
We need to craft a burner mining drill and underground belts.
There are no entities on the map, so we need to start from scratch.
We need to gather raw resources, craft intermediate products, and then craft the final products.
We also need to craft 2 stone furnaces: one for smelting and one for the burner mining drill recipe.
