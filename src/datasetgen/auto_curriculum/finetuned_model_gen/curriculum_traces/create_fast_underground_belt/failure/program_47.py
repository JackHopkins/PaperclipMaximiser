Policy to craft a fast-underground-belt from scratch

We need to craft the following intermediate items:
- 20 iron gear wheels
- 2 transport belts
- 2 underground belts

We need to gather and smelt the following resources:
- 40 iron plates (for iron gear wheels)
- 4 iron plates (for transport belts)
- 80 iron ore (to smelt into iron plates)
- 40 coal (to fuel the furnace for smelting)
