Step 1: Print recipes. We need to print the recipes for the following items:
- stone-furnace
- fast-underground-belt

Step 2: Gather resources. We need to gather the following resources:
- Mine at least 12 stone
- Mine at least 40 iron ore
- Mine at least 40 coal

Step 3: Craft stone furnaces. We need to craft 2 stone furnaces using 10 stone.

Step 4: Set up smelting operation. We need to:
- Place one stone furnace
- Fuel the furnace with coal
- Smelt iron ore into iron plates (at least 40 iron plates)

Step 5: Craft iron gear wheels. We need to craft 40 iron gear wheels using 80 iron plates.

Step 6: Craft underground belts. We need to craft 2 underground belts using 20 iron gear wheels and 20 iron plates.

Step 7: Craft fast-underground-belt. We need to craft 1 fast-underground-belt using 2 underground belts and 20 iron gear wheels.

Step 8: Verify the crafted item. We need to check the inventory to ensure we have 1 fast-underground-belt.
