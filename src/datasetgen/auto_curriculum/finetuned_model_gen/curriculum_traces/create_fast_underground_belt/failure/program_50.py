Sure! The plan we will use is:

To craft a fast-underground-belt, we need to craft an underground-belt first. An underground-belt requires 10 iron gear wheels and 5 iron plates. A fast-underground-belt requires 2 iron gear wheels and 1 underground-belt.
We need 2 iron gear wheels for a fast-underground-belt and 10 iron gear wheels for an underground-belt. In total, we need 12 iron gear wheels. Each iron gear wheel requires 2 iron plates, so we need 24 iron plates for the gear wheels.
Additionally, we need 5 iron plates for the underground-belt, making it a total of 29 iron plates needed.
We have no items in our inventory and no mining setup on the map, so we need to gather all the resources and craft the necessary items from scratch.
The main steps will be:
1. Print recipes
2. Gather resources (iron ore, coal, stone)
3. Set up basic smelting infrastructure (stone furnace)
4. Smelt iron plates
5. Craft iron gear wheels
6. Craft underground-belt
7. Craft fast-underground-belt
