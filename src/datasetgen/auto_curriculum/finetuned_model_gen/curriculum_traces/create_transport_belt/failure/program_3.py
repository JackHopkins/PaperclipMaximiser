Crafting plan to create a transport-belt from an empty inventory:

We need to craft one transport-belt. To do this, we need to:
1. Print recipes for stone furnace and transport belt
2. Mine stone and craft a stone furnace
3. Place the stone furnace
4. Mine iron ore
5. Smelt iron ore into iron plates
6. Craft iron gear wheel
7. Craft transport belt

The policy will follow these steps to craft the required item from scratch.
