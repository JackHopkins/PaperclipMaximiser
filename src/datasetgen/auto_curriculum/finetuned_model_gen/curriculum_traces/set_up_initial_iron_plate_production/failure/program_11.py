Objective: Set up initial iron plate production

Planning:
We need to set up a basic iron plate production line.
There are no entities on the map and our inventory is empty, so we need to craft everything from scratch.
We need to mine iron ore and coal, craft a stone furnace and a burner mining drill, and set up the smelting process.
