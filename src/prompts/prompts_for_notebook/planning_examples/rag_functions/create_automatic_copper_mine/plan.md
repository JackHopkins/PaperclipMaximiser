Plan Analysis:
Firstly we must craft the entities as there are no resources or entities in our inventory. For that we must first print out recipes, gather resources and craft all the required entities.

###START OF PLAN
STEP 1: Print recipes. We need to craft a burner mining drill, a burner inserter, a wooden chest and some transport belts (atleast 10). We must print the recipes of all the items we need to craft
STEP 2: Gather resources. We need to gather the resources needed to craft the items required. As the recipes involve smelting ore into plates, we also need to gather coal and stone to craft a furnace. We also need to gather coal to fuel the burner drill on the copper ore and the chest inserter. Therefore we need to gather:
- Enough coal to fuel the inserter and furnace
- Enough copper and iron for crafting the required entities
- Enough stone for 2 stone furnaces, one for crafting the drill and one for smelting the plates
STEP 3: Smelt plates. We need to smelt the plates using a stone furnace. We also need the craft the stone furnace. The substeps are then
- Craft a stone furnace for smelting, place it down and fuel it
- Smelt the plates using the stone furnace
STEP 4: Craft the entities. We need to craft the following entities
- Burner mining drill
- Burner inserter
- Wooden chest
- Transport belts (atleast 10)
