Plan Analysis:
To solve this objective, we need a electric mining drill for placement on coal and a power generator system, which consists of a offshore pump, boiler and steam engine and multiple pipes to connect them, we need atleast 8 pipes. We also need coal to power the boiler to generate electricity. Finally we need to connect the electric mining drill with the generating system with electric poles, we need atleast 8
Firstly We do not need to craft anything as all the entities are in our inventory, including the multiple pipes and poles. We need atleast 8 pipes and poles and we have more of 8 for both of them
Therefore the first step is to create the power generating system. We need to place down the offshore pump, boiler and steam engine and connect them with pipes 
After that we must place the electric minng drill onto a coal patch and connect it to the steam engine with electric power poles

###START OF PLAN
STEP 1: Place down the offshore pump. We need to move and place down the offshore pump at a water source
STEP 2: Build electric system. We need to place the boiler and steam engine next to the offshore pump and connect them with pipes. We need to carry out the following tasks
- Put a boiler next to the offshore pump with a spacing of 2 to leave room for pipe connections and fuel the boiler with coal
- Put a steam engine next to the boiler with a spacing of 2 to leave room for pipe connections
- Connect the boiler with offshore pump with the pipes and the boiler with steam engine with the pipes
STEP 3: Place electric mining drill. We need to move to the closest coal patch and put down the electric mining drill
STEP 4: Power electric mining drill. We need to power the electric mining drill by connecting it with power poles to the steam engine
