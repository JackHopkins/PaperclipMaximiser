Plan Analysis:
To solve this objective, first we need to notice that only one furnace exists on map. Therefore we need two burner inserters (one to take from furnace and one to put to chest) and we do have two burner inserters in our inventory with some transport belts, coal for fuel for the insterers and the chest. Therefore we do not need to craft anything. 
First we need to put down the chest and a burner inserter next to it. Then we need to rotate the inserter as by default it takes items not puts items from an entity. After that we need to put a inserter next to the furnace (do not need to rotate as we need to take from the furnace) and connect the pickup position of the chest insterter with the drop position of the furnace inserter with transport belts. Finally we need to fuel both inserters. 

###START OF PLAN
STEP 1: Place down the chest and rotated inserter. We need to carry out the following substeps:
- Move and put down a chest at the origin
- Put a inserter next to the chest and rotate it
- Fuel the inserter
STEP 2: Put down a inserter next to the furnace. We need to carry out the following substeps:
- Get the furnace entity from the map and move to it
- Place down a inserter next to it and fuel the inserter
STEP 3: Connect inserters. We need to connect the pickup position of the chest insterter with the drop position of the furnace inserter with transport belts. We also need to then check if items from the furnace are sent to the chest by waiting 30 seconds and checking the chest afterwards
