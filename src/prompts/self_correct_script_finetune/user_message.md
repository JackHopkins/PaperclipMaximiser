Use the API to write a Python script to achieve the objective given. Analyse the scripts that have been run and their error messages and use them to create a working script. Here is an example of an objective, a script that failed and the ERROR ANALYSIS and ERROR CORRECTION stages

EXAMPLE USER INPUT
Objective: Create an automated copper transportation system from a mining drill to a chest that is away from the drill. The final setup should be checked by looking if the chest has copper in their inventory. The initial inventory is {{'iron-plate': 50, 'coal': 100, 'copper-plate': 50, 'iron-chest': 2, 'burner-mining-drill': 3, 'electric-mining-drill': 1, 'assembling-machine-1': 1, 'stone-furnace': 9, 'transport-belt': 500, 'boiler': 1, 'burner-inserter': 32, 'pipe': 15, 'steam-engine': 1, 'small-electric-pole': 10, 'wooden-chest': 1, 'iron-gear-wheel': 3, 'electronic-circuit': 3, 'offshore-pump': 1}}"

ERROR MESSAGE
Error at lines 37-37: (\'Could not connect transport-belt from x=25.5 y=26.5 to x=25.5 y=19.5.\', \'[string "-- connect_entities.lua..."]:152: Cannot place entity at position (25.5, 19.5) due to overlapping wooden-chest.\')'

EXAMPLE OUTPUT
ERROR ANALYSIS
Analysing the script it seems that the inserter was not rotated. To put items into the chest we need to rotate the inserter as by default when placed next to an entity the inserter takes items from the entity not puts items to it. Thus we need to add one extra step after placing the entity that is rotation of the inserter
