Steps
Step 1 - Print out the location of the nearest iron patch
Step 2 - Calculate all the ingredients and print out all the recipes required to craft for 1 burner mining drill, 1 burner inserter, 1 wooden chest, 1 stone furnace and 50 transport belts. Do not craft anything, only print out the requirements
Step 3 - Gather 87 iron ore, 10 stone and 2 wood
Step 4 - Smelt 87 iron plates
Step 5 - Craft for 1 burner mining drill, 1 burner inserter, 1 stone furnace, 1 wooden chest and 50 transport belts
Step 6 - Create a iron plate mine from a drill at Position(x = 11, y = 12) and connect it to a chest 10 spaces away. Check the construct by looking if the chest has iron plates in them
Output - An automatic iron plate mine has been created to the drill at Position(x = 11, y = 12) to the chest at Position(x = 5, y = 9)

Global objective
Craft 5 offshore pumps to make an engine block
Map setup
The following entities are on the map [{{"name": "wooden-chest", "inventory": [("iron-plate", 10)], "position": Position(x = 0, y = 1)}}]
Initial inventory
{{}}
Steps
Step 1 - Calculate all the ingredients and print out all the recipes required to craft for 5 offshore pumps. Do not craft anything, only print out the requirements
Step 2 - Get the 10 iron plates from the chest at Position(x = 0, y = 1)
Step 3 - Gather 25 iron ore and smelt 25 iron plates
Step 3 - Craft for 5 offshore pumps
Output - 5 offshore pumps have been created

Global objective
Create an automatic coal mining setup into a chest
Map setup
The following entities are on the map [{{"name": "wooden-chest", "inventory": [("iron-plate", 10)], "position": Position(x = 0, y = 1)}}]
Initial inventory
{{"burner-mining-drill": 3,
                            "stone-furnace": 9,
                            "transport-belt": 150,
                            "burner-inserter": 5,
                            "coal": 10}}
Steps
Step 1 - Print out the location of the nearest coal patch and calculate the distance from that to the chest at Position(x = 0, y = 1) using the get_connection_amount function. Print out if we have enough transport belts to cover the distance
Step 2 - Create a coal mine from a drill at center of coal patch to a chest placed 10 spaces away. Check the coal mine by looking if the chest has coal
Output - An automatic coal mine has been created to the drill at Position(x = 11, y = 12) to the chest at Position(x = 5, y = 9)

Global objective
Move iron ore from the chest to the furnace to smelt it
Map setup
The following entities are on the map [{{"name": "wooden-chest", "inventory": [("iron-ore", 10),("burner-inserter", 5), ("transport-belt": 50)], "position": Position(x = 0, y = 1)}}, {{"name": "stone-furnace", "position": Position(x = 12, y = 1)}}]
Initial inventory
{{}}
Steps
Step 1 - Get the burner inserters and transport belts from the chest at Position(x = 0, y =  1).
Step 2 - Calculate the distance between Position(x = 0, y = 1) and Position(x = 12, y = 1) using get_connection_amount function. Print out if there are enough transport belts to make the connection
Step 2 - Create a connection that moves iron ore from chest at Position(x=0, y=1) to the furnace at Position(x=12, y=1). Check the connection by looking if the furnace has smelted iron plates in it
Output - Connection that moves items from chest at Position(x=0, y=1) to furnace at Position(x=12, y=1) has been created


Global objective
Put down a powered electric mining drill on a copper ore
Map setup
The following entities are on the map [Generator(name='steam-engine', position=Position(x=-43.5, y=-31.5),  type='generator', prototype=<Prototype.SteamEngine: ('steam-engine', <class 'factorio_entities.Generator'>)>, health=400.0, warnings=['not connected to power network'], status=<EntityStatus.NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK: 'not_plugged_in_electric_network'>]
Initial inventory
{{"electric-mining-drill": 1, "small-power-pole": 100}}
Steps
Step 1 - Print out the location of the nearest copper patch and calculate the distance from that to the steam engine at Position(x=-43.5, y=-31.5) using the get_connection_amount function. Print out if we have enough power poles to cover the distance
Step 2 - Put down a electric mining drill on the copper patch at Position(x = -11, y = -10)
Step 3 - Power the electric mining drill by connecting the drill with the steam engine at Position(x=-43.5, y=-31.5) with power poles
Output - Electric mining drill at Position(x = -11, y = -10) has been placed and powered using the stem engine at Position(x=-43.5, y=-31.5)

Global objective
Create a electricity power generating setup
Map setup
There are no entities on the map
Initial inventory
{{"boiler": 1, "steam-engine": 1, "offshore-pump": 1, "pipe": 20, "coal": 5}}
Steps
Step 1 - Print out the location of the nearest water source and move to the water source
Step 2 - Put down a offshore pump at the nearest water source and a boiler 4 tiles away from the offshore pump. Connect the boiler to the offshore pump with pipes. Print the position of the boiler and offshore pump
Step 3 - Put down a steam engine 4 tiles away from the boiler at Position(x = 11, y = 12). Connect the steam engine to the boiler with pipes. Print the position of the steam engine
Step 4 - Power the boiler at Position(x = 11, y = 11) with coal and check that the steam engine at Position(x = 15, y = 11) is generating power.
Output - An electricity generator has been created with a offshore pump at Position(x = 7, y = 12), boiler at Position(x = 11, y = 12) and steam engine at at Position(x = 15, y = 11)
