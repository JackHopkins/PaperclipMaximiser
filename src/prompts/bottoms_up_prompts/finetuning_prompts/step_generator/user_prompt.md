Global objective
Create a automatic coal mining setup into a chest
Map setup
The following entities are on the map [{{"name": "wooden-chest", "inventory": [("iron-plate", 10)], "position": Position(x = 0, y = 1)}}]
Initial inventory
{{"burner-mining-drill": 3,
                            "stone-furnace": 9,
                            "transport-belt": 150,
                            "burner-inserter": 5,
                            "coal": 10}}
Steps
Step 1 - <step>Print out the location of the nearest coal patch and calculate the distance from that to the chest at Position(x = 0, y = 1) using the get_connection_amount function. Print out if we have enough transport belts to cover the distance </step>
Step 2 - <step>Create a coal mine from a drill at center of coal patch to a chest placed 10 spaces away. Check the coal mine by looking if the chest has coal </step>
<output>An automatic coal mine has been created to the drill at Position(x = 11, y = 12) to the chest at Position(x = 5, y = 9) </output>

Global objective
Move iron ore from the chest to the furnace to smelt it
Map setup
The following entities are on the map [{{"name": "wooden-chest", "inventory": [("iron-ore", 10),("burner-inserter", 5), ("transport-belt": 50)], "position": Position(x = 0, y = 1)}}, {{"name": "stone-furnace", "position": Position(x = 12, y = 1)}}]
Initial inventory
{{}}
Steps
Step 1 - <step>Get the burner inserters and transport belts from the chest at Position(x = 0, y =  1). </step>
Step 2 - <step>Calculate the distance between Position(x = 0, y = 1) and Position(x = 12, y = 1) using get_connection_amount function. Print out if there are enough transport belts to make the connection </step>
Step 2 - <step>Create a connection that moves iron ore from chest at Position(x=0, y=1) to the furnace at Position(x=12, y=1). Check the connection by looking if the furnace has smelted iron plates in it </step>
<output>Connection that moves items from chest at Position(x=0, y=1) to furnace at Position(x=12, y=1) has been created </output>


Global objective
Put down a powered electric mining drill on a copper ore
Map setup
The following entities are on the map [Generator(name='steam-engine', position=Position(x=-43.5, y=-31.5),  type='generator', prototype=<Prototype.SteamEngine: ('steam-engine', <class 'factorio_entities.Generator'>)>, health=400.0, warnings=['not connected to power network'], status=<EntityStatus.NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK: 'not_plugged_in_electric_network'>]
Initial inventory
{{"electric-mining-drill": 1, "small-power-pole": 100}}
Steps
Step 1 - <step>Print out the location of the nearest copper patch and calculate the distance from that to the steam engine at Position(x=-43.5, y=-31.5) using the get_connection_amount function. Print out if we have enough power poles to cover the distance </step>
Step 2 - <step>Put down a electric mining drill on the copper patch at Position(x = -11, y = -10) </step>
Step 3 - <step>Power the electric mining drill by connecting the drill with the steam engine at Position(x=-43.5, y=-31.5) with power poles </step>
<output>Electric mining drill at Position(x = -11, y = -10) has been placed and powered using the stem engine at Position(x=-43.5, y=-31.5) </output>

Global objective
Create a electricity power generating setup
Map setup
There are no entities on the map
Initial inventory
{{"boiler": 1, "steam-engine": 1, "offshore-pump": 1, "pipe": 20, "coal": 5}}
Steps
Step 1 - <step>Print out the location of the nearest water source and move to the water source </step>
Step 2 - <step>Put down a offshore pump at the nearest water source and a boiler 4 tiles away from the offshore pump. Connect the boiler to the offshore pump with pipes. Print the position of the boiler and offshore pump </step>
Step 3 - <step>Put down a steam engine 4 tiles away from the boiler at Position(x = 11, y = 12). Connect the steam engine to the boiler with pipes. Print the position of the steam engine </step>
Step 4 - <step>Power the boiler at Position(x = 11, y = 11) with coal and check that the steam engine at Position(x = 15, y = 11) is generating power. </step>
<output>An electricity generator has been created with a offshore pump at Position(x = 7, y = 12), boiler at Position(x = 11, y = 12) and steam engine at at Position(x = 15, y = 11) </output>
