ERROR MESSAGE
'2: Error at lines 93-93: (\'Could not place stone-furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\', \'[string "global.actions.place_entity = function(player..."]:21: The target position is too far away to place the entity. The player position is 20.5, 18.5 and the target position is 0, 0. The distance is 27.613402542968 and the max distance is 10. Move closer.\')'

EXAMPLE OUTPUT
ERROR ANALYSIS
Analysing the functions and the error message it seems that the user is trying to place the furnace too far away from them. We thus need to move closer to the furnace position if we want to place it there
ERROR CORRECTION
