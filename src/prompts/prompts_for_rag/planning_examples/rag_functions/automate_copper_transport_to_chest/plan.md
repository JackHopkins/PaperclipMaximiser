To solve this objective, we need a burner mining drill, a burner inserter, a wooden chest and transport belts.
First step - We first need to place down the drill that we have in our inventory at a copper patch and fuel it. We need to first move to the coal, then place the drill and then insert fuel to the drill.
Second step - Then we need to put down the wooden chest. We currently do not have a wooden chest in our inventory. We then need to mine wood, craft the chest and place down the chest away from the drill. We first need to move to the chest position as we can't place items far away and then place the chest
Third step - We then need to put down an inserter that puts items to the chest. We have an inserter in our inventory so we don't need to craft it. 
Fourth step - We also need to rotate the inserter to face the chest as by default it takes from the chest. We then also need to fuel the inserter.
Last step -  We need to connect the inserter and the drill with transport belts. We have transport belts in our inventory. We need to use the drop position of the drill and the pickup position of the inserter.
