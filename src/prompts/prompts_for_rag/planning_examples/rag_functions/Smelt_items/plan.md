To achieve this objective we first need to check if we have enough iron and coal in the inventory to smelt the iron plates. We can check using the input_coal input_iron_ore variables. 
Then we will insert the input coal and iron ore into the furnace from the inventory. We will use the input furnace variable 
We will then wait and extract the iron plates
Finally we will assert that we have enough iron plates using the output_iron_plate variable
