Objective: We need to smelt iron ores into plates with a furnace
Mining setup: We have a furnace on the map that we can use to smelt iron ores
Inventory: We have enough iron and coal in the inventory to smelt the iron plates
:param input_coal (int): The number of coal to insert into the furnace
:param input_iron_ore (int): The number of iron ore to insert into the furnace
:param furnace (Prototype.StoneFurnace): The furnace entity to use for smelting
:param output_iron_plate (int): The number of iron plates to extract from the furnace
:return: None as the iron plates will be in inventory
