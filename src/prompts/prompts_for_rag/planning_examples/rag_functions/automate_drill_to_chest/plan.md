To solve this objective, we first need to place down the burner inserter next to the chest at the given direction. We have an inserter in our inventory so we don't need to craft it. We need to place it next to the chest input variable.
We also need to rotate the inserter to face the chest as by default it takes from the chest. We then also need to fuel the inserter.
Then we need to connect the chest inserter and the input drill variable with transport belts. We need to use the drop position of the drill and the pickup position of the inserter
Finally we need to return the inserter object
